  title: Real-time payments, everywhere.
  description: >
    Join the real-time revolution! Give your customers a faster, easier and
    safer way to pay. Volt has developed a REST API for merchants, allowing you
    to offer the option to use Open Banking payments on your online checkout.



    ## NEW : API idempotency 


    We have introduced support for idempotency on the POST endpoints in the Volt
    Connect endpoints of the API.  The idea of idempotency is to avoid unwanted
    duplication should a request to our API fail and need to be retried. 


    Using a unique idempotency key for each POST request, it is possible to
    safely retry the same call multiple times with the guarantee that it will
    only be actioned once.


    ### Endpoints supporting idempotency

    If an endpoint supports idempotent processing, we'll indicate this in the
    header documentation for that endpoint.


    ### Using an idempotency key


    Using the idempotency key is optional.  If you would like to use it to help
    prevent duplicates in your POST requests, simply include the header
    ```idempotency-key: <key>``` - where  ```<key>``` is a unique identifier for
    the message.  We recommend using a **UUID** for the key, however you may use
    any other unique identifier you choose. 


    ### Retries

    If the request times out or you don't receive a response for any other
    reason, you may safely retry it using the same payload and headers.  Use the
    same key for the retried attempt. 


    ### Preventing duplicates 

    If we have already processed the request and you send a request using the
    same idempotency key, it will fail with an error, returning an HTTP code of
    ```409``` Conflict. 


    ### Exponential backoff for retries

    You should adopt an exponential backoff strategy when retrying requests
    using the same idempotency key. For example, retry 1 second later then, if
    it fails again, 2 seconds later, 4 seconds later etc.

        This will create a payout request to send funds from your Connect
        account to a beneficiary.  For regulatory purposes, it's a closed-loop
        payout system, meaning you may only payout funds to a person or
        organisation you've previously received money from using Volt Connect.


        ### Usage

        Pass the details of the payout you'd like to make in the body of the
        request.


        ### Approval

        Payouts don't require approval if you create them using the API.  If you
        need to review payouts before sending, this workflow should take place
        on your own system before you call this endpoint.

        This endpoint allows you to request a payment report for a specific
        period.  Once requested, your report will be generated asynchronously
        and available at the ```/reports/id/download endpoint``` as a CSV file
        once it's been generated.  Check on the availability status of your
        report using the ```/reports/{id}``` endpoint.


        The ```startDate``` and ```endDate``` may be a maximum of **92 days**
        apart, so you can generate reports containing 3 months data.


        If you supply a ```customerId``` for any merchant within your customer
        hierarchy, only that merchant's data will be returned.  


        If a ```customer ID``` is **not** provided, the report will contain data

        The period between `startDate` and `endDate` must not exceed 92 days,
        allowing for quarterly reports. Specifying a `customerId` filters the
        report to include data exclusively for that merchant. Without a
        `customerId`, the report covers all merchants in your customer
        hierarchy.
