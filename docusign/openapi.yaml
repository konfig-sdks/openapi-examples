      The Accounts resource provides methods that allow you to create, delete,
      and manage your accounts.

      The Envelope resource provides methods that allow you to manipulate and
      monitor envelopes. 


      Once you have authenticated the user you can use the Envelopes:
      createEnvelope method to create an envelope. You can call the
      EnvelopeDocuments: update or EnvelopeDocuments: updateList method to add
      additional documents.


      Setting the `status` property on the envelope to `sent` allows you to send
      it or `created` to save it as a draft.


      You can receive envelope event notifications by setting the
      `eventNotification` properties. When the envelope or recipient status
      changes to one of the specified status codes, a notification is sent to a
      URL that you specify.


      If you have an envelope that you have previously saved, you can modify the
      subject and message, send it, void it, or place it in the purge queue
      using the Envelope: update method.


      In addition to receiving notifications you can monitor the status of the
      envelopes using the following methods:

      * Envelope: getEnvelope - To get the status of a envelope. 

      * Envelope: listStatus - To get the envelope status for a set of
      envelopes.

      * Envelope: listStatusChanges - To get status changes information for one
      or more envelopes. 


      If you need to delete a page from a document in an envelope, use the
      Envelope: deleteDocumentPage method.


      The resource also includes a number of methods that allow you to retrieve
      and set the initials and signature for certain types of recipients on the
      document.
    name: Envelopes
  - description: >-
      The AcccountBrands resource provides methods that enable you to create and
      manage brands for an account.


      Branding enables you to add the look and feel of your organization's brand
      to the sending, signing, and email processes, making it easier for
      recipients to identify envelopes coming from your organization.


      The DocuSign Account Custom Branding feature enables you to set the
      colors, logo, and text that recipients see at the account level. The
      settings associated with a brand are applied to all of the envelopes that
      use the brand. You can create multiple brand profiles for different
      corporate brands or internal departments.


      **Note:** To use this resource, branding for either signing or sending
      must be enabled for the account (either `canSelfBrandSend`,
      `canSelfBrandSign`, or both of these account settings must be set to
      **true**). 
    name: AccountBrands
  - description: >-
      The Template resource provides methods that allow you to manipulate and
      monitor templates. 


      Once you have authenticated the user you can use the Templates:
      createTemplate method to create a template. You can call the
      TemplateDocuments: update or TemplateDocuments: updateList method to add
      more documents.


      If you have a template that you have previously saved, you can modify the
      subject and message, send it, void it, or purge it from the DocuSign
      system using the Template: update method.


      In addition to receiving notifications, you can monitor the status of the
      templates using the following methods:


      * Template: getTemplate - Gets the status of a template. 

      * Template: listStatus - Gets the status for a set of templates.

      * Template: listStatusChanges - Gets status change information for one or
      more templates. 


      If you need to delete a page from a document in a template, use the
      Template: deleteDocumentPage method.


      The resource also includes a number of methods that allow you to retrieve
      and set the initials and signature for certain types of recipients on the
      document.
    name: Templates

      You can use bulk send lists send documents to a large number of recipients
      on a

      recurring basis. You can use a bulk send list to send up to 1,000 copies
      at a time.


      After you create a bulk send list, it persists and can be reused and
      edited any number of times.


      You can customize individual copies of the envelope. For example, you can
      customize the email notification and

      language and add personalized notes.


      ### Requirements and limitations


      * Bulk send must be enabled for your account. To enable this feature,
      contact your Account Manager or Business Development representative.

      * You can include up to 1,000 bulk recipients in each request.

      * When you send an envelope with bulk recipients, envelopes are added to a
      bulk recipient queue and sent in a metered fashion.
        An account can have a total of 2,000 total envelopes in the queue at a time.
        If you reach this limit, you will get an error message. Wait and resend the envelope at a later time.
        If you hit queue limits often, contact your Account Manager to see about modifying the queue limits for your account.

      The `ConnectConfigurations` resource enables you to configure the

      DocuSign Connect service for your account.


      You can use this resource to configure account-level webhooks

      that send notifications about every envelope sent from your

      account. You can set account-level webhooks to listen for events

      for envelopes sent by a specific user on your account, by

      multiple specific users, or from any of the users on your

      account. These events will be tracked, and can be delivered to a

      listening application.


      **Note:** To create an envelope-level webhook instead of using

      account-level webhooks, use the Envelopes::Create method and add

      an `eventNotification` object to an envelope object.



      DocuSign Connect offers two delivery modes:


      - Send Individual Messages

      - Send Aggregated Messages


      By default, the Send Individual Messages mode

      is enabled.

      You can disable it

      (enabling Aggregated Messages mode)

      through DocuSign Admin

      in the **Updates** section.



      **Note:** In either mode, Connect

      [must be
      enabled](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=pik1583277475390&topicId=ctv1583277395112.html)

      in your DocuSign account. It is not enabled by default.



      ## Send Individual Messages


      Send Individual Messages (SIM) mode is the default.


      In this mode DocuSign delivers notifications for each

      envelope events individually.

      When a final recipient completes an envelope,

      your listener will receive

      a single **Recipient Signed/Completed** event

      followed by a single **Envelope Signed/Completed** event

      for the final participating party on the agreement.


      For more information about SIM mode, see

      [Using Connect's Send Individual Messages
      Feature](https://www.docusign.com/blog/developers/using-connects-send-individual-messages-feature).




      ## Aggregated Messages


      In Aggregated Messages mode,

      Connect aggregates similar events

      into a single delivery.

      Similar or simultaneous events

      are aggregated,

      so that your listener doesn't

      receive extraneous messages.


      When the final recipient signs an envelope,  the

      system delivers a single, aggregated Connect event, rather than

      separate Recipient: complete and Envelope: complete messages.

      This aggregation process ensures that you only receive the

      minimal viable number of messages about an envelope's life cycle.

      The EnvelopeRecipients resource enables you manage the recipients of an
      envelope.

      All recipient types share a set of [core
      parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com),

      but some recipient types have additional parameters.

      You specify the recipient type using the `recipientType` parameter. The
      recipient types are as follows:


      <br>


      | Recipient type                                      |

      Agent recipients can add name and email information for recipients that
      appear after the agent in routing
      order.

      | [Carbon Copy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)               | Carbon
      copy recipients get a copy of the envelope but don't need to sign,
      initial, date, or add information to any of the documents. This type of
      recipient can be used in any routing order. Carbon copy recipients receive
      their copy of the envelope when the envelope reaches the recipient's order
      in the process flow and when the envelope is
      completed.                                                                           
      |

      | [Certified Delivery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) | Certified
      delivery recipients must receive the completed documents for the envelope
      to be completed. However, they don't need to sign, initial, date, or add
      information to any of the
      documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
      |

      | [Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)                         |
      Editors have the same management and access rights for the envelope as the
      sender. They can make changes to the envelope as if they were using the
      Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email
      information, add or change the routing order, set authentication options,
      and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining
      recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor. |

      | [In-Person Signer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)     | In-person
      signer recipients are DocuSign users who act as signing hosts in the same
      physical location as the
      signer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
      |

      | [Intermediary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)             |
      Intermediaries are recipients who can, but are not required to, add name
      and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in
      the routing order, unless subsequent agents, editors, or intermediaries
      are
      added.

      | [Seal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)                             |
      Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities rather than
      individuals. Organizations and governments can use electronic seals to
      show evidence of origin and integrity of
      documents.

      | [Signer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)                         |
      Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or add data to form
      fields on the documents in the
      envelope.

      | [Witness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)                       |
      Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that the identified
      signers have signed the documents in the
      envelope.

      String                                                                |
      This is a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded
      recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives
      an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the
      document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through
      DocuSign, to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL,
      it is up to the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then
      request a recipient token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the
      value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed
      to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The
      signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
      transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect
      this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or
      viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is
      important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the
      authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the
      sending application and DocuSign expects that senders will follow their
      own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow
      the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded
      signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending
      application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to
      `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or
      viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication
      steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends
      that one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
      Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the
      identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT
      set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores
      the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
      recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL`
      property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
      envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields.
      The customFields must be part of the recipient or envelope. The merge
      fields are enclosed in double
      brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/

      optional array of strings that allows the sender to provide custom data
      about the recipient. This information is returned in the envelope status
      but otherwise not used by DocuSign. String `customField` properties have a
      maximum length of 100
      characters.

      Optional. Specifies ID Verification applied on an envelope by workflow ID.
      <br/>See the [list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) method in the
      [IdentityVerifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) resource for
      more information on how to retrieve workflow IDs available for an account.
      <br/>This can be used in addition to other [recipient
      authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) methods. <br/>Note that
      ID Verification and ID Check are two distinct methods. ID Verification
      checks recipients' identity by verifying their ID while ID Check relies on
      data available on public records (such as current and former
      address).

      ## Carbon Copy Recipient


      Carbon copy recipients receive a copy of the envelope but don't need to
      sign, initial,

      date or add information to any of the documents. You can place this type
      of recipient in any routing order.

      Carbon copy recipients receive their copy of the envelope when the
      envelope

      reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the envelope is
      completed.

      They can make changes to the envelope as if they were using the Advanced
      Correct feature.

      This recipient can add name and email information,

      add or change the routing order and set authentication options for the
      remaining recipients.

      ## In-Person Signer Recipient


      An in-person recipient is a DocuSign user, acting as a Signing Host, who
      is in the same physical location as the signer.


      The following restrictions apply to using electronic notary when sending
      documents:


      * Authentication methods are allowed for the signer but not the notary.

      * The Sign On Paper, Document Markup, Field Markup and Change Signer
      options cannot be used for the documents.

      * Tabs may be assigned to the signer, but cannot be assigned to the
      notary.


      See [eNotary Resources][enotary-resources] in the DocuSign Support Center
      for more information about how the eNotary feature works.


      In addition to the [core parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com),

      ## Intermediary Recipient


      An intermediary is a recipient who can, but is not required to,

      add name and email information for recipients

      at the same or subsequent level in the routing order,

      unless subsequent agents, editors or intermediaries are added.


      In addition to the [core parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com),
      this recipient type has the following parameters:


      <br>



      | Name               | Required | Schema Type        |
      Description

      | :----------------- | :------- | :----------------- |
      :---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      |

      | documentVisibility | No       | documentVisibility | A complex type that
      specifies which documents are visible to this recipient. |


      <br>




      ## Seal Recipient


      An electronic seal recipient is a legal entity rather than an actual
      person.

      Electronic Seals can be used by organizations and governments to show
      evidence

      of origin and integrity of documents.

      Even though electronic seals can be represented by a tab in a document,

      they do not require user interaction and apply automatically in the order
      specified by the sender.

      The sender is therefore the person authorizing usage of the electronic
      seal in the flow.


      Electronic seal recipients rely on a subset of core properties, described
      as follows, plus the `recipientSignatureProviders` parameter:



      <br>



      | Name                        | Required        | Schema
      Type                                                           |
      Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
      |

      | :-------------------------- | :-------------- |
      :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
      :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      |

      | recipientId                 | Yes             | String<br/><br/>The
      string must be formatted as an integer or a GUID. | Indicates the unique
      ID of the applied electronic
      seal.

      Specifies the routing order of the electronic seal in the envelope. <br
      />The routing order assigned to your electronic seal cannot be shared with
      another recipient. It is recommended that you set a routing order for your
      electronic seals.. |

      | recipientSignatureProviders | Yes             |
      String                                                                |
      Indicates which electronic seal to apply on documents when creating an
      envelope.                                                                                                                                                                
      |



      <br>


      By default, Electronic Seals apply to all documents in an envelope.

      However, the `sealDocumentsWithTabsOnly` property (see
      `recipientSignatureProvider`)

      allows you to seal only documents that have `signHere` tabs set for the
      Electronic Seal recipients.


      <br>




      ## Signer Recipient


      A signer is a recipient who must sign, initial, date, or add data to form
      fields on the documents in the envelope.


      In addition to the [core parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com),
      this recipient type adds the following parameters:

      PowerForms enable you to create self-service documents for signature. A
      PowerForm is an envelope initiated from a URL that you make available for
      signers to complete. You can either add a PowerForm to your website or
      email the URL to recipients. DocuSign saves the data that recipients enter
      so  you can easily integrate it with your other applications.


      For more information, see [Using
      PowerForms](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=jbx1643062255110&topicId=eke1578456649038.html).


      **Note:** PowerForms are available only for DocuSign Enterprise accounts.



      ### Errors


      PowerForm methods return the following 404 errors:


      - `PowerForms_Recipient_Denied_Documents`: The recipient is denied access
      to the documents.

      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Shared_Tabs_Not_Allowed`: Shared tags are not
      allowed because a digital certificate is required

      for a signer.

      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Free_Form_Tabs_Not_Allowed`: Signers that are
      required to use a digital certificate must have at

      least one required, non-conditional signature or initials tab.

      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Multiple_Recipients_Routing_Order`: Signers
      that are required to use a digital certificate must be the

      only recipient in a routing order. Edit the routing order or remove the
      digital certificate requirement.

      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Markup_Not_Allowed`: Document markup is not
      allowed because a digital certificate is

      required for a signer.

      - `PowerForms_Incomplete_Recipient`: The recipient's username, email, or
      role is not set.

      - `PowerForms_PowerFormId_Required`: A `powerFormId` is required.

      - `PowerForms_PowerFormId_Mismatch`: A `powerFormId` mismatch has
      occurred.

      The SigningGroups resource provides methods that allow you manage signing
      groups.


      Signing Groups allow you to create a group of people to which an envelope
      is sent. Any member of that group can open an envelope and sign the
      documents in the envelope with their own signature, even though a
      signature field was not directly assigned to them. When the Signing Group
      option is used, group members that open and sign the envelope are tracked
      in the envelope history and certificate.


      When one group member opens the envelope, it is temporarily locked and if
      other members try to open the envelope they will see a message saying the
      envelope is currently opened. If the group member exits the envelope
      without finishing the lock expires, allowing other group members to open
      and complete the envelope.


      When the envelope is complete, all members of the group will receive a
      completed notification and can access the completed envelope. 

      The envelope history and Certificate of Completion will show that the
      envelope was sent to a signing group and record which members viewed and
      signed the envelope.


      An account can have a maximum of 50 signing groups. Each signing group can
      have a maximum of 50 group members.


      The Signing Groups feature is only supported in certain DocuSign
      Enterprise and System Automated Premium plans. Your account might not
      support this option. To access this functionality, contact your Account
      Manager or DocuSign Support (support@docusign.com) for assistance.


      For more information, see [Signing
      Groups](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=gav1643676262430&topicId=zgn1578456447934.html).

      The TemplateRecipients resource allows you manage the recipients of an
      template.


      The exact parameters associated with a recipient depend on the recipient
      type. There are seven recipient types: Agents, Carbon Copies, Certified
      Deliveries, Editors, In Person Signers, Intermediaries, and Signers.


      Not all recipients are are available to all account types, review you
      account plan to determine which recipient types are available to you. If
      you are working in the development environment, all recipient types are
      available.


      Each recipient type is described below:


      [Agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com): This recipient can add name
      and email information for recipients that appear after the recipient in
      routing order.


      [Carbon Copies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com): Use this action if the
      recipient should get a copy of the template, but the recipient does not
      need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents.
      This type of recipient can be placed in any order in the recipient list.
      The recipient receives a copy of the template when the template reaches
      the recipient's order in the process flow and when the template is
      completed.


      [Certified Deliveries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com): Use this action
      if the recipient must receive the completed documents for the template to
      be completed, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date or
      add information to any of the documents.


      [Editors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com): This recipient has the same
      management and access rights for the template as the sender and can make
      changes to the template as if they were using the Advanced Correct
      feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change
      the routing order and set authentication options for the remaining
      recipients. Additionally, this recipient can edit signature/initial tabs
      and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a
      DocuSign account to be an editor.


      [In Person Signers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com): Use this action if
      the signer is in the same physical location as a DocuSign user who will
      act as a Signing Host for the transaction. The recipient added is the
      Signing Host and new separate Signer Name field appears after Sign in
      person is selected.


      [Intermediaries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com): This recipient can,
      but is not required to, add name and email information for recipients at
      the same or subsequent level in the routing order (until subsequent
      Agents, Editors or Intermediaries recipient types are added).


      [Signers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com): Use this action if your
      recipient must sign, initial, date or add data to form fields on the
      documents in the template.

      | addAccessCodeToEmail | No | Boolean | This optional attribute indicates
      that the access code is added to the email sent to the recipient; this
      nullifies the Security measure of Access Code on the recipient. |

      | clientUserId | No | String | This specifies whether the recipient is
      embedded or remote.<br/><br/>If the `clientUserId` property is not null
      then the recipient is embedded. Note that if the `ClientUserId` property
      is set and either `SignerMustHaveAccount` or `SignerMustLoginToSign`
      property of the account settings is set to  **true,** an error is
      generated on sending. |

      | embeddedRecipientStartURL | No | String | This is a sender provided
      valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this
      option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just
      as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the email is
      clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL to
      complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's
      system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient
      token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value
      `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an
      embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
      viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction
      activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all
      other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing
      operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important
      to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an
      embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and
      DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for
      establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes
      through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing
      process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets  the
      `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient
      goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the
      sending application and any authentication steps the sending application
      would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal
      DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS
      Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the
      recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the
      `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect
      URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.
      Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property
      using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: templateId,
      recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The
      customFields must be part of the recipient or template. The merge fields
      are enclosed in double
      brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/
      beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` |

      | customFields | No | customField |An optional array of strings that
      allows the sender to provide custom data about the recipient. This
      information is returned in the template status but otherwise not used by
      DocuSign. String `customField` properties have a maximum length of 100
      characters. |

      | emailNotification | No | emailNotification | An optional complex type
      that has information for setting the language for the recipient's email
      information. It is composed of three elements:<br/><br/>*emailBody*: a
      string with the email message sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length:
      10000 characters.<br/><br/>*emailSubject*: a string with the subject of
      the email sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100
      characters.<br/><br/>*supportedLanguage*: The simple type enumeration of
      the language used. The supported languages, with the language value shown
      in parenthesis, are: Arabic (ar), Bahasa Indonesia (id), Bahasa Melayu
      (ms) Bulgarian (bg), Czech (cs), Chinese Simplified (zh_CN), Chinese
      Traditional (zh_TW), Croatian (hr), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English US
      (en), English UK (en_GB), Estonian (et), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French
      (fr), French Canada (fr_CA), German (de), Greek (el), Hebrew (he), Hindi
      (hi), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Latvian
      (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Norwegian (no), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt),
      Portuguese Brazil (pt_BR), Romanian (ro),Russian (ru), Serbian (sr),
      Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es),Spanish Latin America (es_MX),
      Swedish (sv), Thai (th), Turkish (tr), Ukrainian (uk) and Vietnamese
      (vi).<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT:** If this is enabled for one recipient, it
      overrides the Template Subject and `EmailBlurb` property settings. Also,
      you must set the  `emailNotification` property for all recipients. |

      | excludedDocuments | No | Array of Strings | Specifies the documents that
      are not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for
      the account and the enforceSignerVisibility property must be set to true
      for the template to use this.<br/><br/>When the enforceSignerVisibility
      property is set to **true,** documents with tabs can only be viewed by
      signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an
      administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational
      role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the
      documents in an template, unless they are specifically excluded using this
      setting when an template is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are
      always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded
      using this setting when an template is sent. |

      | idCheckConfigurationName | No | String |Specifies authentication check
      by name. The names used here must be the same as the authentication type
      names used by the account (these name can also be found in the web console
      sending interface in the Identify list for a recipient). This overrides
      any default authentication setting.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/> Your account
      has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console
      Identify list these appear as 'ID Check $' and 'SMS Auth $'. To use ID
      check in an template, the `idCheckConfigurationName` property must be  set
      to `ID Check $`. To use SMS, it must be set to `SMS Auth $` and you must
      add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.|

      | iDCheckInformationInput | No | IdCheckInformationInput | This complex
      element contains input information related to a recipient ID check. It can
      include the following information.<br/><br/>*addressInformationInput*:
      Used to set recipient address information and consists
      of:<br/><br/>*addressInformation*: consists of six elements, with street2

      The CustomTabs resource provides methods that allow you create and manage
      custom tabs based on the existing DocuSign tabs.


      You can create a tab with pre-defined properties, such as a text tab with
      a certain font type and validation pattern. Users can access the custom
      tabs when sending documents through the DocuSign web application.


      Custom tabs can be created based on the  approve, checkbox, company, date,
      date signed, decline, email, email address, envelope ID, first name,
      formula, full name, initial here, last name, list, note, number, radio,
      sign here, signer attachment, SSN, text, title, and zip tabs.

      DocuSign eSignature includes a contacts list (also referred to as an
      address book) to help make sending envelopes even easier. When you send an
      envelope, the recipients' names and email addresses are automatically
      added to your contacts list. You can use the contacts list to quickly add
      recipients to the envelopes you send. The `Contacts` resource provides

      Envelope attachments are files that are associated an envelope.

      They are not visible to senders or to recipients

      and are not converted to PDF or any other format.

      These are files that your application uses to store information.


      Envelope attachments are available only through the API. 


      <!-- std notice DEVDOCS-114911 -->

      <ds-inlinemessage kind="information" markdown="1">


      It's easy to confuse envelope attachments,

      which are developer-only files associated with an envelope,

      with signer attachments.

      An account permission profile is assigned to a group of users, enabling
      you to set permissions for all of the users in the group at the same time.
      You are not required to set Permission Profiles for a group, but it makes
      it easier to manage user permissions for a large number of users. 


      DocuSign offers the following account permission profiles:


      - DocuSign Viewer

      - DocuSign Sender

      - Account Administrator


      You can also create your own custom account permission profiles.

      A workspace is a collaborative space for sharing documents and managing
      workflows. A workspace has a single owner who must be a DocuSign user. The
      owner can invite others to the workspace as collaborators. Individuals who
      are not DocuSign users must create a DocuSign account to join a workspace
      as a collaborator.
       
      You can create an envelope directly from a workspace.


      Workspaces store the following information:


      - **Files:** Files uploaded to a workspace for storage or reuse.

      - **Documents:** A document is a component of a transaction, template, or
      workspace. When a file is added to a transaction, template, or workspace,
      it is copied as a document. Each document in a workspace has a single
      owner.

      - **Templates:** A set of documents that you can use to create a
      transaction or a workspace.

      - **Transactions:** A transaction is a series of workflow events related
      to one or more documents. These events route the documents to one or more
      individuals for the purposes of doing business. Each transaction has a
      single owner (the sender).


      **Note:** Documents in a template are not individually listed as files.

      A chunked upload is a temporary file that you upload in parts and stage at
      DocuSign, then refer to as the content for other API calls. For example,
      you might use it for document content when assembling an envelope or
      template. 


      A chunked upload is linked to the DocuSign account member who initiated
      the API call. This user is the only user who is able to reference the
      chunked upload.


      A ChunkedUpload is intended to be an area for briefly staging data for use
      with other DocuSign API calls. The ChunkedUpload API endpoints do not
      provide an action to download the ChunkedUpload's content.


      The typical flow for using a chunked upload involves the following steps:


      1) Initiate the chunked upload with content representing part 0.


      2) Add more parts to the chunked upload until you have transmitted the
      entirety of the content.


      3) Commit the chunked upload, preparing it for use with other API calls.


      4) Assemble a DocuSign envelope with a document that includes a reference
      to the chunked upload as the content.


      5) Continue with envelope-related processes.


      **Note:** You must fully upload and use a chunked upload within 20 minutes
      of initializing it.


      After the chunked upload has been correctly referenced within another API
      call, it becomes unavailable for any further use and is promptly removed
      from the system.


      Chunked uploads have the following limits, which are configured per
      DocuSign environment, account, or integrator:


      - The maximum number of all of a member's unexpired, unconsumed
      ChunkedUploads. The default value is 64. 

      - The maximum total size of all of a member's unexpired, unconsumed 
      ChunkedUploads. The default value is 1 GB. 

      - The amount of time that a chunked upload is active after you initialize
      it. The default value is 20 minutes.

      Envelope transfer rules enable administrators to transfer envelopes and
      templates from user to another. For example, you might do this when an
      employee leaves the company. To transfer ownership of envelopes and
      templates, the **Transfer Custody** feature must be enabled for your
      account.


      For more information about this functionality, see [Transfer Envelopes and
      Templates](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=pik1583277475390&topicId=vyz1583277376194.html).

      Custom fields enable you to record custom information about envelopes that
      you can then use for sorting, organizing, searching, and other downstream
      processes. 


      For example, you can use custom fields to copy envelopes or data to
      multiple areas in Salesforce. eOriginal customers can eVault all of their
      documents from the web app by setting an account custom field with a name
      like `eVault with eOriginal` to **true.**


      You can also use account custom fields to set the following information:


      - Tracking ID

      - Department 

      - Use case

      - Other envelope metadata


      ## Envelope Custom Field Visibility


      When you create an envelope custom field for your account, you have the
      following options: 


      - Make it a required field for senders at the time of sending

      - Display it as an optional field at the time of sending

      - Set a specific value for the field behind the scenes (NOT SURE IF THIS
      IS RIGHT; MIGHT JUST BE AN UNUSED DRAFT FIELD)


      Envelope recipients do not see the envelope custom fields.


      ## Types of Envelope Custom Fields


      There are two types of envelope custom fields:


      - `text`: Enables the sender to enter the value for the field. 

      - `list`: Enables the sender to select the value of the field from a
      predetermined list.
    name: AccountCustomFields
  - description: >+
      The EnvelopeCustomFields resource provides methods that allow you manage
      custom fields in an envelope.


      Custom fields can be used in the envelopes for your account to record
      information about the envelope, help search for envelopes and track
      information. The envelope custom fields are shown in the Envelope Settings
      section when a user is creating an envelope in the DocuSign member
      console. The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope
      recipients.


      There are two types of envelope custom fields:


      - `text`: Enables the sender to enter the value for the field.

      - `list`: Enables the sender to select the value of the field from a

      The EnvelopeDocumentFields resource provides methods that allow you to
      manage custom fields on a document.


      Custom fields are name-value pairs that are returned by the API but
      otherwise not used by DocuSign. They are not seen by the envelope
      recipients.

      Envelope locks allow you to manage locks on an envelope.


      To prevent users from changing an envelope while another user is

      modifying it, you can lock the envelope and set the time until

      the lock expires.


      To use envelope locks, the user must have envelope locking capability
      enabled.

      ## Tab Types


      Some tabs enable values to be entered by the signer.

      Those tabs' values can be preset either through the web browser

      or via the API. Other tab types use information that is already

      recognized by the DocuSign platform.

      These tabs cannot have their value updated on a per-tab basis

      by the API or via the browser. In some cases, the info might be

      settable using a different technique.

      For example, the Full name tab uses the signer's name,

      which is set elsewhere in the request.


      Here is the list of tabs and whether you can or cannot set their values in
      the tab definition:

      | Date (`date`)                                  | Allows the recipient to
      enter a date. Date tabs are one-line fields that allow date information to
      be entered in any format. The tooltip for this tab recommends entering the
      date as MM/DD/YYYY, but this is not enforced. The format entered by the
      signer is retained. If you need a particular date format enforced,
      DocuSign recommends using a Text tab with a validation pattern and a
      validation message to enforce the format. This value can be
      set.

      the option of declining an envelope. If the recipient clicks the tab
      during the signing process, the envelope is voided. This value **can't**
      be
      set.

      | Email (`email`)                                | Allows the recipient to
      enter an email address. This is a one-line field that checks that a valid
      email address is entered. It uses the same parameters as a Text tab, with
      the validation message and pattern set for email information.<br><br>When
      getting information that includes this tab type, the original value of the
      tab when the associated envelope was sent is included in the response.
      This value can be
      set.

      | Formula Tab (`formulaTab`)                     | The value of a formula
      tab is calculated from the values of other number or date tabs in the
      document. When the recipient completes the underlying fields, the formula
      tab calculates and displays the result. This value can be set. The
      `formula` property of the tab contains the references to the underlying
      tabs. See [Calculated Fields] in the DocuSign Support Center to learn more
      about formulas. If a formula tab contains a `paymentDetails` property, the
      tab is considered a payment item. See [Requesting Payments Along with
      Signatures] in the DocuSign Support Center to learn more about payments. |

      ## Requesting Payments


      The Payments feature of the DocuSign eSignature REST API

      lets you collect payments

      along with signatures and other information.


      To send a request for payment

      and collect payments,

      you need a payment gateway account,

      which is the destination for the payments.

      Create a payment account

      with a supported payment gateway,

      and then connect the payment gateway account

      to your DocuSign account.

      To learn how to connect a payment gateway account

      to your DocuSign account

      see [Managing Payment Gateways][paymentgateways]

      in the DocuSign Support Center.

      You must connect and manage payment gateway accounts manually

      through the DocuSign Admin console

      and through your chosen payment gateway.

      There is no public API

      for connecting payment gateway accounts

      to DocuSign accounts

      or for managing payment gateway accounts.


      Currently

      [Stripe][stripe],

      [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/),

      [Authorize.net](https://www.authorize.net/),

      [CyberSource](https://www.cybersource.com/),

      [Zuora](https://www.zuora.com/), and

      [Elavon](https://www.elavon.com/)

      are the supported payment gateways.


      ### How Payments Work


      To make a request for payment,

      use a [`formulaTab`][formulatab]

      that has a

      [`paymentDetails`][paymentdetails] object.

      This object includes

      a list of [`paymentLineItem`][paymentlineitem] objects.

      Each line item refers to a [`number`][numbertab] tab

      that contains the value of the each item.

      The purpose of the line items

      is to transmit them to the payment gateway

      as metadata, so that you can use the information

      in the payment processor.


      **Note:** If the `fileExtension` parameter is not added in an API call,
      only base64 converted PDF files will be accepted.

      Any attempt to send a non-PDF file without using `fileExtension` results
      in an error.


      This is an example request for two books.

      Each book is specified in the `number` tabs

      labeled "Hamlet" and "Tempest".

      The books are referenced as line items

      by their tab labels

      within the `paymentDetails` object

      of a `formula` tab.

      The formula of the `formula` tab

      add the values of the same two `number` tabs.


      **Note:** This example uses US dollars, a decimal currency,

      so the price is multiplied

      by 100. If you are using a zero-decimal currency,

      such as Japanese yen, _do not_ multiply by 100.

      Use the

      to check the status of a payment.

      When the payment is successful,

      the `status` property of

      the [`paymentDetails`][paymentdetails] object

      is `payment_complete`.

      #### How to make a request for future payments


      Use the following steps to make a request to collect a signer's payment
      method for future use:


      1. Add a text tab with a descriptive `tabLabel` such as `FuturePayment`.

      2. In the formula tab's `paymentDetails` object, add a `lineItem` object
      that references the `tabLabel` from step 1.


      **Note:** Do not include this new `lineItem` in formula calculations.


      The following example builds on the previous code block to also collect a
      payment method for future use:

      ### Some Things to Keep in Mind About Payments


      * An envelope is not completed until all payments are completed.


      * If you are using a a decimal currency, such as USD,
        remember to multiply amounts by 100. If you are using
        zero-decimal currency, such as JPY, _do not_ multiply by 100.

      * If a DocuSign account Administrator
        deletes a payment gateway account connection
        DocuSign cancels all in-process envelopes
        that reference the deleted payment gateway account.

      * If the sender voids an envelope,
        all payment authorizations are canceled.

      * If a required recipient refuses to sign,
        all authorized payments are canceled.

      * If a required recipient's payment fails authorization,
        DocuSign attempts to recover
        by sending the recipient
        notification about the failed payment authorization.
        The recipient has the opportunity
        to correct the payment method information.

      * Each recipient's payment is authorized separately.
        Accounts are charged and payment made
        after all required tabs are completed,
        and all payments in an envelope for all recipients are authorized.

      * Refunds are not supported.
        Conduct refunds or payment changes
        with the payment gateway separately from DocuSign.

      * At this time, DocuSign does not charge a per-transaction fee.

      ## Anchoring Tabs


      The tab anchoring option

      allows you to send documents for signature

      that do not have a fixed layout or format.

      In these documents you might not know

      the absolute location of the tabs

      when you design your API client application because the tabs must move
      with text.

      As an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,

      the DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab

      by correlating anchor information to data within the document.


      When the DocuSign Service receives a request that contains tabs

      with anchor information,

      it searches the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.

      When found,

      it places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.

      Tab positions are established by setting offsets for the tab.


      When you apply tabs to the document,

      DocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString`
      property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as
      the background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign
      processes and it will not be visible on the document.


      To use an anchoring option:


      1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a
      pre-existing text string or add a new one.

      For best performance DocuSign recommends using single word anchor strings
      when possible, especially when there are a large number of pages in the
      envelope.

      For example, you might want to add a Sign Here tab to the "Borrower's
      Signature" lines in a document, but that phrase might occur in places in
      the document where you don't want to tab to appear. In this case, you
      could add the text "BorrowerSignHere" in white font color (so that isn't
      visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here tabs to
      appear and use "BorrowerSignHere" as the anchor string.

      1. Reference the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.

      1. Determine the offset from the anchor string location to where the tab
      should be placed.


      Setting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab
      right on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves
      the tab down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used
      for the offsets.

      For Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string
      is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is
      placed relative to that.

      For all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to
      position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to
      that.

      DocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values.
      Determination of the proper offset will likely require some
      trial-and-error.


      ### Rules for working with anchor tags


      When anchor tabs are used, all documents in the envelope are searched for
      the `anchorString` property.


      * You set the text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property.
      DocuSign tabs are created for each instance of the `anchorString` property
      within the document, so special care must be taken to establish unique
      anchor strings that do not result in unintentional tabs.

      * You cannot use the same anchored tab for different recipients for the
      same document.

      * The DocuSign system cannot search for text that is embedded in an image
      when checking for anchor strings.

      * X or Y offsets supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in
      the document. To use different offsets at different locations in the
      document for the same recipient, create multiple, unique anchor tabs.

      * If the Y offset value of an anchor string would force a tab outside of
      the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page boundary. If the X
      offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries, the error
      message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes the X
      offset that resulted in the error.

      * The system does not support an anchor string embedded in the form of a
      PDF X-object in the document.

      * The system does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It
      is the responsibility of the document author to provide sufficient white
      space to contain the potential width of the ultimate tab value.


      ### Tips and Tricks


      The following are tips for effective use of anchor tags:

      * In order to avoid unintentional conflicts between text contained in an
      `anchorString` property and the text that naturally exists in documents,
      establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text that is unlikely to
      appear elsewhere in a document.

      * Develop an extensible and consistent syntax that can be used across
      multiple document types.

      * Especially for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers,
      author the source document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential
      signers/permutations. Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by
      including/excluding the anchor tabs in the request. This approach allows a
      single document to be used for all use cases instead of maintaining
      separate documents for each scenario.


      ## Automatically Populating Tabs


      If you want similar tab types

      to automatically populate with the same data,

      you must follow these guidelines:


      * Each `tabLabel` entry must have the characters
        `\\*` in front of the label.
        If you omit the `\\*` prefix,
        only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.

        When automatically populating tabs,
        the `tabLabel` must not contain any spaces.
        In the JSON example below,
        the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName` and `StudentFirstName`
        will be auto-populated as specified ("Doe" and "John")
        each place they appear throughout the envelope.

        ```
        "tabs": {
          "textTabs": [
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentLastName",
            "value": "Doe"
          },
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentFirstName",
            "value": "John"
          }]
        }
        ```

      * Note that `\\*` matches _anything_.  If you were to add
        another tab with the `tabLabel` set to `\\*Name` to the
        example above, it would end up matching the other two
        labels as well.

      * Each occurrence of the tab must have identical properties.

        For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,
        each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.
        If one tab has the `bold` property set to **true,**
        and the other has the `bold` property set to **false,**
        only the first one will be populated.
        In order to automatically populate both occurrences
        of the `Name` Text tabs,
        the `bold` property must be set to the same value for both tabs.

      Email override settings change the reply to email address, name, or the
      BCC for email archive information, for the envelope. Note that changing
      email settings will only affect email communications that occur after the
      addition was made.


      The BCC Email address feature is designed to provide a copy of all email
      communications for external archiving purposes. DocuSign recommends that
      envelopes sent using the BCC for Email Archive feature, including the BCC
      Email Override option, include additional signer authentication options.
      To send a copy of the envelope to a recipient who does not need to sign,
      use a Carbon Copies or Certified Deliveries Recipient Type.

      ## Tab Types


      This table lists the available tab types.


      <br>



      | Tab Type              | Description |

      | :-------              | :---------- |

      | Approve Tab           | Place this tab on the document if you want the
      recipient to approve documents in an envelope without placing a signature
      or initials on the document. If the recipient clicks the Approve tab
      during the signing process, the recipient is considered to have signed the
      document. No information is shown on the document for the approval, but it
      is recorded as a signature in the envelope history. |

      | Checkbox Tab          | Place this tab on the document in a location
      where the recipient can select a yes/no (on/off) type option. |

      | Company Tab           | Place this tab on the document where you want
      the recipient's company name to appear. |

      | Date Signed Tab       | Place this tab on the document where you want
      the date the recipient signed the document to appear. |

      | Date Tab              | Place this tab on the document where you want
      the recipient to enter a date. Date tabs are single-line fields that allow
      date information to be entered in any format. The tooltip for this tab
      recommends entering the date as MM/DD/YYYY, but this is not enforced. The
      format entered by the signer is retained. If you need a particular date
      format enforced, DocuSign recommends using a Text tab with a Validation
      Pattern and Validation Message to enforce the format. |

      | Decline Tab           | Place this tab on the document where you want to
      give the recipient the option of declining an envelope. If the recipient
      clicks the Decline tab during the signing process, the envelope is voided.
      |

      | Email Address Tab     | Place this tab on a document where you want the
      recipient's email, as entered in the recipient information, to appear. |

      | Email Tab             | This is a single-line field that accepts all
      characters. |

      | Envelope ID Tab       | Place this tab on the document where you want
      the envelope ID for to appear. Recipients cannot enter or change the
      information in this tab. It is for informational purposes only. |

      | First Name Tab        | Place this tab on a document where you want the
      recipient's first name to appear. This tab splits the recipient's name (as
      entered in the recipient information) into sections based on spaces and
      uses the first section as the first name. |

      | Formula Tab           | This tab is used to add a calculated field to a
      document. Envelope recipients cannot directly enter information into the
      tab. The formula tab calculates and displays a new value when changes are
      made to the reference tab values. The reference tab information and
      calculation operations are entered in the "formula" element. See the Using
      the Calculated Fields Feature quick start guide or DocuSign Service User
      Guide for more information about formulas.  |

      | Full Name Tab         | Place this tab on the document where you want
      the recipient's full name to appear. |

      | Initial Here Tab      | Place this tab where the recipient must initial
      the document. This tab can be set to be optional.  |

      | Last Name Tab         | Place this tab on a document where you want the
      recipient's last name to appear. This tab splits the recipient's name (as
      entered in the recipient information) into sections based on spaces and
      uses the last section as the last name. |

      | List Tab              | This tab has a list of options that a recipient
      can select. The `listItems` parameter is used to set the options that can
      be selected.  |

      | Note Tab              | Place this tab on the document where you want to
      add a note for the recipient on a document. |

      | Number Tab            | This tab is a field where the recipient can
      enter numbers and decimal (.) points.  |

      | Radio Group Tab       | This group tab is used to place radio buttons on
      a document. The `radios` parameter is used to add and place the radio
      buttons associated with the group. Only one radio button can be selected
      in a group.  |

      | Sign Here Tab         | Place this tab where the recipient must sign the
      document. This tab can be set to be optional.  |

      | Signer Attachment Tab | The signer attachment is where the recipient
      initiates the process of adding supporting documents to an envelope. |

      | SSN Tab               | This tab is a single-line field where the
      recipient can enter numbers. A Social Security Number can be typed with or
      without dashes. |

      | Text Tab              | This tab is a field where the recipient can
      enter any type of characters.  |

      | Title Tab             | Place this tab on the document where you want
      the recipient's title to appear. |

      | Zip Tab               | This tab is a single-line field where the
      recipient can enter numbers. |



      ## Using Custom Tabs in Envelopes and Templates 


      Custom Tabs can be added to envelopes and templates

      by setting the `customTabId` property

      when creating an envelope or template recipient

      or when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.

      The custom tab must be added as the correct tab type.

      For example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot be used as a number
      tab.


      When the `customTabId` property is set,

      the new tab inherits all the custom tab properties.

      Required information that is not included in the custom tab,

      such as document ID and page ID, must be included when adding the tab.

      If the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X and Y positions
      must be included.


      After the tab is created,

      it is treated as any other tab for updating or deleting. 


      ## Anchoring Tabs


      The tab anchoring option

      allows you to send documents for signature

      that do not have a fixed layout or format.

      In these documents you might not know

      the absolute location of the tabs

      when you design your API client application because the tabs must move
      with text.

      As an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,

      the DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab

      by correlating anchor information to data within the document.


      When the DocuSign Service receives a request that contains tabs

      with anchor information,

      it searches the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.

      When found,

      it places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.

      Tab positions are established by setting offsets for the tab.


      When you apply tabs to the document,

      DocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString`
      property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as
      the background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign

      For best performance DocuSign recommends using single word anchor strings
      when possible, especially when there are a large number of pages in the
      envelope. 

      For example, you might want to add a Sign Here tab to the "Borrower's
      Signature" lines in a document, but that phrase might occur in places in
      the document where you don't want to tab to appear. In this case, you
      could add the text "BorrowerSignHere" in white font color (so that isn't
      visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here tabs to
      appear and use "BorrowerSignHere" as the anchor string. 

      1. Reference the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.

      1. Determine the offset from the anchor string location to where the tab
      should be placed. 


      Setting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab
      right on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves
      the tab down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used
      for the offsets.

      For Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string
      is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is
      placed relative to that.

      For all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to
      position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to
      that.

      DocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values.
      Determination of the proper offset will likely require some
      trial-and-error.


      ### Rules for working with anchor tags


      When anchor tabs are used, all documents in the envelope are searched for
      the `anchorString` property.


      * You set the text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property.
      DocuSign tabs are created for each instance of the `anchorString` property
      within the document, so special care must be taken to establish unique
      anchor strings that do not result in unintentional tabs.

      * You cannot use the same anchored tab for different recipients for the
      same document.

      * The DocuSign system cannot search for text that is embedded in an image
      when checking for anchor strings.

      * X or Y offsets supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in
      the document. To use different offsets at different locations in the
      document for the same recipient, create multiple, unique anchor tabs.

      * If the Y offset value of an anchor string would force a tab outside of
      the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page boundary. If the X
      offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries, the error
      message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes the X
      offset that resulted in the error.

      * The system does not support an anchor string embedded in the form of a
      PDF X-object in the document.

      * The system does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It
      is the responsibility of the document author to provide sufficient white
      space to contain the potential width of the ultimate tab value.


      ### Tips and Tricks


      The following are tips for effective use of anchor tags:

      * In order to avoid unintentional conflicts between text contained in an
      `anchorString` property and the text that naturally exists in documents,
      establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text that is unlikely to
      appear elsewhere in a document.

      * Develop an extensible and consistent syntax that can be used across
      multiple document types.

      * Especially for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers,
      author the source document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential
      signers/permutations. Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by
      including/excluding the anchor tabs in the request. This approach allows a
      single document to be used for all use cases instead of maintaining
      separate documents for each scenario.


      ## Automatically Populating Tabs


      If you want similar tab types

      to automatically populate with the same data,

      you must follow these guidelines:


      * Each `tabLabel` entry must have the characters
        `\\*` in front of the label.
        If you omit the `\\*` prefix,
        only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.

        When automatically populating tabs,
        the `tabLabel` must not contain any spaces.
        In the JSON example below,
        the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName` and `StudentFirstName`
        will be auto-populated as specified ("Doe" and "John")
        each place they appear throughout the envelope.

        ```
        "tabs": {
          "textTabs": [
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentLastName",
            "value": "Doe"
          },
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentFirstName",
            "value": "John"
          }]
        }
        ```

      * Each occurrence of the tab must have identical properties.

        For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,
        each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.
        If one tab has the `bold` property set to **true,**
        and the other has the `bold` property set to **false,**
        only the first one will be populated.
        In order to automatically populate both occurrences
        of the `Name` Text tabs,
        the `bold` property must be set to the same value for both tabs.

      The `AccountConsumerDisclosures` resource provides methods that enable you
      to enable, retrieve, and manage the Electronic Record and Signature
      Consent Disclosure (ERSD) options for your account. This is the disclosure
      that displays to each new recipient who is going to sign or add other
      information, or who is required to view the documents you send to them.
      The recipient must read and agree to the terms of the disclosure before
      they can access and take action on the documents you send. The ERSD does
      not apply to copy-only recipients, but does apply to recipients who must
      sign or view your documents.


      You can use either the default ERSD that DocuSign provides for U.S.-based
      transactions, or a custom ERSD. 


      ## Languages


      **Important:** The system does not translate the ERSD for you. The default
      ERSD is always in English. For a custom ERSD, an account administrator
      must create a version of the disclosure for each language that your
      signers use. When you create a version of your custom ERSD for a specific
      signer language, you must:


      1. Specify the language code (`langCode`) for the signer language.

      2. Provide the `esignAgreementText` and `esignText` in the language
      associated with the `langCode`.

      Standards-Based Signatures (SBS) is the label used to describe DocuSign's
      suite of signatures that comply with regional and industry regulations,
      such as the electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services
      (eIDAS) regulation in Europe.


      ## Feature Differences When Using Standards-Based Signatures


      Some DocuSign features are not compatible with Standards-Based Signatures,
      while others work somewhat differently. It's important to understand these
      key differences.


      ### DocuSign Features Not Compatible with SBS


      - Attachment by fax

      - Concatenation of signer attachments

      - Legacy digital signatures

      - Markup

      - Notary


      ### DocuSign Features That Change with SBS


      The following features work slightly differently with SBS:


      - **Advanced Correct:** After the first signature, adding or deleting a
      field is not allowed. This behavior occurs because SBS does not allow
      adding or removing form fields after a digital signature has already been
      applied to a PDF.

      - **Downloading Combined Envelopes:** A combined PDF is not digitally
      signed. This behavior occurs because concatenating digitally signed PDFs
      breaks the digital signatures on the PDFs.

      - **Freeform Signing:** After someone has signed, allows only signature
      and initials on free-form. This behavior occurs because if another signer
      has already signed the document, adding fields other than signature fields
      will break the existing digital signatures on the document.

      - **Watermarks:** All watermarks are added as PDF annotations. This
      behavior occurs because burning the watermark into the PDF will break the
      digital signatures on the document.

      - **Wet Signing:** Wet-signed documents are added as new documents to
      envelopes. This behavior results in the uploaded or faxed, physically
      signed document being added as a new document to the envelope. This new
      document gets only a platform seal.

        ```

        If the request succeeds,

        it returns a

        201 (Created) HTTP response code.

        The response returns the new account ID, password, and the default user

        information for each newly created account.



        When creating multiple accounts,

        the body of the request is a

        `newAccountRequests`

        object,

        which contains one or more

        [`newAccountDefinition`][newAccountDefinition]

        objects.

        You can create up to 100 new accounts

        at a time this way.


        The body for a multi-account

        creation request

        looks like this in JSON:


        ```

        {
          "newAccountRequests": [
            {
              "accountName": "accountone",
              . . .
            },
            {
              "accountName": "accounttwo",
              . . .
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        A multi-account request

        looks like this in XML:


        ```

        <newAccountsDefinition
        xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xmlns="http://www.docusign.com/restapi">
          <newAccountRequests>
            <newAccountDefinition>
              . . .
            </newAccountDefinition>
            <newAccountDefinition>
              . . .
            </newAccountDefinition>
          </newAccountRequests>
        </newAccountsDefinition>

        ```


        A multi-account creation request

        may succeed (report a 201 code)

        even if some accounts could not be created.

        In this case, the `errorDetails` property

        in the response contains specific information

        about the failure.

        This method can only be used if the `paymentAllowed` value for a past
        due invoice is true. This can be determined calling
        [Billing::listInvoicesPastDue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).


        The response returns information for a single payment

        if a payment ID was used in the endpoint, or a list of payments.

        If the from date or to date queries or payment ID are not used,

        the response returns payment information for the last 365 days.


        If the request was for a single payment ID, the `nextUri` and
        `previousUri` properties are not returned.

      description: >
        Retrieves the billing plan information for the specified account,
        including the current billing plan, successor plans, billing address,
        and billing credit card.


        By default the successor plan and credit card information is included in
        the response. You can exclude this information from the response by
        adding the appropriate optional query string and setting it to
        **false.**


        Response


        The response returns the billing plan information, including the
        currency code, for the plan. The `billingPlan` and `succesorPlans`
        property values are the same as those shown in the [Billing:
        getBillingPlan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) reference. the
        `billingAddress` and `creditCardInformation` property values are the
        same as those shown in the [Billing:
        updatePlan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) reference.


        **Note:** When credit card number information displays, a mask is
        applied to the response so that only the last 4 digits of the card
        number are visible.

        This method returns a specific branding resource file.


        A brand uses a set of brand resource files to control the sending,
        signing, email message, and captive (embedded) signing experiences.  You
        can modify the default email messages and formats in these files and
        upload them to your brand to customize the user experience.


        **Important:** When you upload a modified resource file, only the
        elements that differ from the master resource file are saved as your
        resource file. Similarly, when you download your resource files, only
        the modified elements are included in the file.

        configuration option which can significantly impact your account, and
        should be done only by someone with expertise in XML and HTML. The

        you review any changes and update your custom files as needed.

      operationId: BulkSendV2Send_PostBulkSendRequest
      description: >+
        This method initiates the bulk send process. It generates a bulk send
        request based on an [existing bulk send list][create_list] and an
        envelope or template.


        Consider using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendTestRequest][create_test]
        method to test your bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope
        or template that you want to send first. To learn about the complete
        bulk send flow, see the [Bulk Send overview][BulkSendOverview].


        If the envelopes were successfully queued for asynchronous processing,
        the response contains a `batchId` that you can use to get the status of
        the batch. If a failure occurs, the API returns an error message.


        **Note:** Partial success or failure generally does not occur. Only the
        entire batch is queued for asynchronous processing.

      operationId: BulkSendV2Test_PostBulkSendTestRequest
      description: >+
        This method tests a bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope
        or template that you want to send. For example, a template that has
        three roles is not compatible with a bulk send list that has only two
        recipients. For this reason, you might want to test compatibility first.


        A successful test result returns `true` for the `canBeSent` property. An
        unsuccessful test returns a JSON response that contains information
        about the errors that occurred.


        If the test is successful, you can then send the envelope or template by
        using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendRequest][BulkSendRequest] method.


        ## Envelope Compatibility Checks


        This section describes the envelope compatibility checks that the system
        performs.


        **Top-Level Issues**


        - Envelopes must be in a sendable state.

        - The bulk send list must contain at least one copy (instance of an
        envelope), and no more than the maximum number of copies allowed for the
        account.

        - The envelope must not be null and must be visible to the current user.

        - The account cannot have more queued envelopes than the maximum number
        configured for the account.

        - The bulk send list must exist.


        **Recipients**


        - The envelope must have recipients.

        - If you are using an envelope, all of the recipients defined in the
        bulk send list must have corresponding recipient IDs in the envelope
        definition. If you are using a template, you must either match the
        recipient IDs or role IDs.

        - The envelope cannot contain a bulk recipient (an artifact of the
        legacy version of DocuSign's bulk send
          functionality).

        **Recipient Tabs**


        - Every `recipient ID, tab label` pair in the bulk send list must
        correspond to a tab in the envelope.


        **Custom Fields**


        - Each envelope-level custom field in the bulk send list must correspond
        to the name of a `customField` in the
          envelope definition. You do not have to match the recipient-level custom fields.

        This method checks the integrity of a chunked upload and then commits
        it. When this request is successful, the chunked upload is then ready to
        be referenced in other API calls.


        If the request is unsuccessful, ensure that you have uploaded all of the
        parts by using the Update method.


        **Note:** After you commit a chunked upload, it no longer accepts
        additional parts.

        This method cannot be used to delete the following types of chunked
        uploads, which the system deletes automatically:



        - Chunked uploads that have been consumed by use in another API call.

        - Expired chunked uploads.


        **Note:** If you are aware of a chunked upload that can be discarded,
        the best practice is to explicitly delete it. If you wait for the system
        to automatically delete it after it expires, the chunked upload will
        continue to count against your quota.

      operationId: ChunkedUploads_PutChunkedUploadPart
      description: >-
        Adds a chunk or part to an existing chunked upload. After you use the
        Create method to initiate a new chunked upload and upload the first
        part, 

        use this method to upload subsequent parts.


        For simplicity, DocuSign recommends that you upload the parts in their
        sequential order ( 1,2, 3, 4, etc.). The Create method adds the first
        part and assigns it the `sequence` value `0`. As a result, DocuSign
        recommends that you start with a `sequence` value of `1` when you use
        this method, and continue uploading parts contiguously until you have
        uploaded the entirety of the original content to DocuSign.


        Example:



        ```

        PUT /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/chunked_uploads/{chunkedUploadId}/1

        PUT /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/chunked_uploads/{chunkedUploadId}/2

        PUT /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/chunked_uploads/{chunkedUploadId}/3

        ```


        **Note:** You cannot replace a part that DocuSign has already received,
        or add parts to a chunked upload that is already successfully committed.

            **Note:** You can add parts out of order. However, the chunked

        Creates a custom Connect configuration for the specified account.


        Connect is a webhook service that provides updates when certain events
        occur in your eSignature workflows. You can use this endpoint to create:

        * Account-level Connect configurations to listen for events related to
        any envelopes sent by one or more account users

        * Recipient Connect configurations that are triggered when one or more
        of your account users receive an envelope


        To set an account-level configuration, set `configurationType` to
        **custom.**

        To set a Recipient Connect configuration, set `configurationType` to
        **customrecipient.**


        If you want to listen for events on only one envelope, use the
        [eventNotification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) object instead.


        **Note:** To use this function, you must be an account administrator and
        Connect must be enabled on your account.


        ## Data models


        There are four possible data models for your Connect configuration.
        Consider:

        * Do you want the data in JSON or XML?

        * Do you want events sent individually (SIM) or in aggregate?


        DocuSign recommends using the [JSON SIM event
        model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).


        <ds-column>


        <ds-step open="false" hideIcon="true">

        <h3>JSON SIM (Recommended)</h3>

        <div>


        Set `deliveryMode` to **SIM** and `eventData.version` to **restv2.1.**
        Use the `events` property to set the event statuses that will trigger
        your configuration.


        The following sample request shows how to create an envelope-level
        configuration using JSON SIM:

        ```

        {
          "configurationType": "custom",
          "urlToPublishTo": "YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL",
          "allUsers": "true",
          "name": "jsonSimTest",
          "deliveryMode": "SIM",
          "allowEnvelopePublish": "true",
          "enableLog": "true",
          "eventData": {

              "envelope-completed"
          ]
        }

        ```


        The following sample request shows how to create a Recipient Connect
        configuration using JSON SIM:

        ```

        {
          "configurationType": "customrecipient",
          "urlToPublishTo": "YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL",
          "allUsers": "true",

        ## Troubleshooting


        If your configuration is not working, check the following.


        * Connect must be enabled for your account to use this function.

        * If you are using `envelopeEvents` or `recipientEvents`, make sure that
        the event values are sentence case, not lowercase.

        * Make sure you have either set `allUsers` to **true** or set `userIds`
        to a non-empty array of IDs.

        * By default, this endpoint creates a disabled configuration. To enable
        the configuration immediately, set the body parameter
        `allowEnvelopePublish` to **true.** You can also enable the
        configuration in the UI.

        * To check if events are being emitted, set `enableLog` to **true** to
        view event logs in the Connect console.

        This endpoint submits a batch of existing envelopes to a webhook of your
        choice. Set the webhook address with the `urlToPublishTo` request body
        parameter.


        This endpoint does not call an existing Connect configuration or create
        a new Connect listener to monitor new activity. It simply uses an ad hoc
        configuration to submit existing envelopes. You must include all the
        configuration data in the request body.


        The envelope data will always be transmitted in JSON format. XML,
        Salesforce, and eOriginal configuration types are not supported.


        Your request should match the following format:


        ```

        {
            "envelopes": ["4280f274-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-b218b7eeda08", "8373a938-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-e992a2abae01"],
            "config": {
                "configurationType":"custom",
                "name": "Test",
                "urlToPublishTo":"YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL",
                "allowEnvelopePublish": "true",
                "enableLog": "true",
                "requiresAcknowledgement": "true",
                "IncludeHMAC": "true",
                "SignMessageWithX509Cert": "true",
                "deliveryMode": "SIM",
                "eventData": {
                    "version": "restv2.1",
                    "format": "json",
                    "includedata": ["tabs","payment_tabs","custom_fields","powerform","recipients","folders","extensions","attachments", "prefill_tabs", "documents"]
                }
            }
        }

        ```


        If the request succeeds, it returns a 201 (Created) HTTP response code
        and the response body property `processingStatus` will be set to
        `processing`. You can then view the status of each historical republish
        request in the [Bulk Actions
        Log](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=pik1583277475390&topicId=nvf1648497452396.html).

        Account administrators can use this method to perform the following
        tasks:


        - Customize values in the default disclosure.

        - Switch to a custom disclosure that uses your own text and HTML
        formatting.

        - Change values in your existing consumer disclosure. 


        To specify the signer language version of the disclosure that you are
        updating, use the optional `langCode` query parameter.


        **Note:** Only account administrators can use this method. Each time you
        change the disclosure content, all unsigned recipients of outstanding
        documents will be required to accept a new version. 


        ## Updating the default disclosure


        When you update the default disclosure, you can edit all properties
        except for the following ones:


        - `accountEsignId`: This property is read-only.

        - `custom`: The default value is **false.** Editing this property causes
        the default disclosure to switch to a custom disclosure.

        - `esignAgreement`: This property is read-only.

        - `esignText`: You cannot edit this property when `custom` is set to
        **false.** The API returns a 200 OK HTTP response, but does not update
        the `esignText`.

        - Metadata properties: These properties are read-only.


        **Note:** The text of the default disclosure is always in English.


        ## Switching to a custom disclosure


        To switch to a custom disclosure, set the `custom` property to **true**
        and customize the value for the `eSignText` property. 


        You can also edit all of the other properties except for the following
        ones:


        - `accountEsignId`: This property is read-only.

        - `esignAgreement`: This property is read-only.

        - Metadata properties: These properties are read-only.


        **Note:** When you use a custom disclosure, you can create versions of
        it in different signer languages and se the `langCode` parameter to
        specify the signer language version that you are updating.


        **Important:**  When you switch from a default to a custom disclosure,
        note the following information:


        - You will not be able to return to using the default disclosure.

        - Only the disclosure for the currently selected signer language is
        saved. DocuSign will not automatically translate your custom disclosure.
        You must create a disclosure for each language that your signers use.


        ## Updating a custom disclosure


        When you update a custom disclosure, you can update all of the
        properties except for the following ones:


        - `accountEsignId`: This property is read-only. 

        - `esignAgreement`: This property is read-only.

        - Metadata properties: These properties are read-only.


        **Important:** Only the disclosure for the currently selected signer
        language is saved. DocuSign will not automatically translate your custom
        disclosure. You must create a disclosure for each language that your
        signers use.

        This method lets you

        [search for envelopes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        in your accounts.

        A large set of filters let you narrow the scope of your search

        by date,

        by envelope ID,

        or by status codes.

        Your request must include one or more of the following parameters:


        * `from_date`

        * `envelope_ids`

        * `transaction_ids`


        <ds-inlinemessage kind="information">

        This method excludes envelopes older than six months.

        </ds-inlinemessage>


        To avoid unnecessary database queries, the DocuSign

        signature platform first checks requests to ensure that the

        filter set supplied does not result in a zero-size response

        before querying the database.


        For example, for a request with a `from_to_status` of

        `delivered` and a current `status` of `created,sent`,

        DocuSign will always return an empty list.

        This is because the request translates to: find the

        envelopes that were delivered between the `from_date` and

        `to_date` dates that have a current status of `created` or

        `sent`. Since an envelope that has been delivered can

        never have a status of `created` or `sent`, a zero-size

        response would be generated.

        In this case, DocuSign does not query the database

        and returns an empty list immediately.


        Getting envelope status using `transaction_ids` is useful

        for offline signing situations where it can be used

        determine if an envelope was created or not. It can be used

        for the cases where a network connection was lost, before

        the envelope status could be returned.


        The following table shows the valid current envelope

        statuses (`status` parameter) for the different status

        qualifiers (`from_to_status` parameter) in the request. If

        the status and status qualifiers in the API request do not

        contain any of the values shown in the Valid Current

        Statuses column, then an empty list is returned.


        Client applications should check that the statuses (`status`

        parameter) they are requesting make sense for a given

        `from_to_status` parameter value.

        ## Extraneous results


        In some cases, a request for a specific envelope status will

        include envelopes with additional statuses. For example, in

        a request with a `from_date` of 2017-01-01, a `to_date` of

        2017-01-07 and the status qualifier (`from_to_status`) set

        to `delivered`, the response set might contain envelopes

        that were created during that time period, but not delivered

        during the time period. As a workaround, check the envelope

        status values in the result set as needed.

            Although you can use any date format

            a time zone offset,

            the method uses the server's time zone.

        Creates and sends an envelope or creates a draft envelope.

        Envelopes are fundamental resources in the DocuSign platform.



        With this method you can:


        * Create and send an envelope
          with [documents][], [recipients][], and [tabs][].
        * [Create and send an envelope from a
        template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).

        * [Create and send an envelope from
          a combination of documents and templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).
        * Create a draft envelope.



        When you use this method

        to create and send an envelope

        in a single request,

        the following parameters in the request body (an
        [`envelopeDefinition`][envelopeDefinition] object) are required:


        | Parameter      | Description |

        | :--------      | :---------- |

        | `status`       | Set to `sent` to send the envelope to
        recipients.<br>Set to `created` (or don't set at all) to save the
        envelope as a draft. |

        | `emailSubject` | The subject of the email used to send the envelope. |

        | `documents`    | The [documents][] to be signed. |

        | `recipients`   | The email addresses of the envelope [recipients][]. |



        When you create an envelope by using a

        [composite template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com),

        you should specify the envelope custom fields in the inline template.

        Any custom fields that you specify at the root level are ignored.


        If the envelope has a workflow definition

        and the `workflowStatus` is `paused`,

        the envelope will not be sent immediately,

        even if the envelope's `status` is `sent`.



        ### Related topics


        [Envelope][envelopes] and [template][templates]

        objects along with [documents][documents],

        [recipients][recipients], and [tabs][tabs]

        are the five object models at the core of the eSignature API.

        The [eSignature concepts guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        describes how the five object models work together.


        The following how-to articles contain

        practical examples that show you how to

          description: >-
            For some documents, one or more signatures must be witnessed by an
            appointed [notary
            public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary_public).


            DocuSign supports eNotary services for many jurisdictions. This
            example demonstrates how to send an envelope to be signed by Susan
            Signer with her signature witnessed by Nancy Notary. You must know
            the name and email address of the signer and the notary public for a
            signature to be notarized.


            Note that the full legal name of the signer must be used. It will be
            checked against the signer's government-issued proof of identity by
            the notary public.


            Please see the [DocuSign eNotary resource
            page](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=gko1642535666104&topicId=jiv1635359045452.html)
            for further information. It lists the jurisdictions participating in
            the DocuSign eNotary program and additional reference information.


            Note that eNotary services are not included with all account types
            and are **not** included by default with demo/developer sandbox
            accounts. To enable eNotary service for your sandbox account,
            contact your DocuSign technical support person or DocuSign customer
            service.


            The example includes event notification via the Connect service.

          description: >
            DocuSign enables document signers to use

            electronic or

            digital signatures.


            DocuSign has tightly integrated standard digital signatures into the
            DocuSign Signature platform. This enables a single envelope to
            include:


            * electronic signatures,

            * AES digital signatures using certificates from DocuSign or from
            your organization,

            * QES digital signatures from government certified Trust Service
            Providers (TSPs).


            This example enables the signer to create an eIDAS compliant AES
            signature with embedded signing. InPerson signers can also use SBS
            digital signatures.


            [More information on creating SBS digital signature
            requests.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)


            The `clientId` in the example tells DocuSign that the Signing
            Ceremony will be embedded.

            The example also includes an `eventNotification` object for
            receiving envelope status updates from DocuSign.


            ## Embedding the signing ceremony

            1. Send the `Envelopes: create` call as shown below in the
            Request/Response section.

            2. The response will include the `envelopeId`

            3. Use the [EnvelopeViews:
            createRecipient](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) request to
            obtain the redirectURL as follows:


            `POST
            /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId}/views/recipient`


            ````

            {
                "clientUserId": "1000",
                "email": "Sam@spade.com",
                "userName": "Sam Spade",
                "returnUrl": "https://your_app.example.com",
                "AuthenticationMethod": "Password"
            }

            ````

            The response will include the `url`. Redirect the user's browser to
            the URL to start the signing ceremony.


            **Note:** You must **immediately** redirect the user to the URL you
            receive from DocuSign. The URL is only valid for 5 minutes. Don't
            request a recipient view URL until you are ready to redirect the
            user's browser.

      operationId: Envelopes_PutEnvelope
      description: >
        This method enables you to make changes to an envelope.

        You can use it to:


        * [Send a draft envelope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        * [Void an in-process envelope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        * [Modify a draft envelope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        * [Purge documents and envelope metadata from the DocuSign
        platform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)


        Although the request body for this method

        is a complete envelope definition,

        you only need to provide

        the properties that

        you're updating.


        ## Sending a draft envelope


        To send a draft envelope, include the following code in the request
        body:


        ```json

        {
          "status": "sent"
        }

        ```


        You can attach a workflow before sending the envelope:


        ```json

        {
          "status": "sent",
          "workflow": {
            "workflowSteps": [
              {
                "action": "pause_before",
                "description": "pause_before routing order 2",
                "itemId": 2,
                "triggerOnItem": "routing_order"
              }
            ]
          }
        }

        ```


        ## Working with workflows


        To unpause a workflow, the request body should include this:


        ```json

        {
          "workflow": {
            "workflowStatus": "in_progress"
          }
        }

        ```


        ## Voiding an in-process envelope


        To void an in-process envelope, include the following code in the
        request body:


        ```json

        {
          "status": "voided",
          "voidedReason": "The reason for voiding the envelope"
        }

        ```


        ## Modifying envelope email information


        To change the email subject and message of a draft envelope,

        include the following code in the request body:


        ```json

        {
          "emailSubject": "new email subject",
          "emailBlurb": "new email message"
        }

        ```


        ## Purging documents from DocuSign


        To place only the documents

        in the purge queue,

        leaving any

        corresponding attachments

        and tabs in the DocuSign platform,

        set the `purgeState` property

        to `documents_queued`.


        ```json

        {
          "envelopeId": "222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca",
          "purgeState": "documents_queued"
        }

        ```


        To place documents,

        attachments,

        and tabs

        in the purge queue,

        set the `purgeState` property

        to `documents_and_metadata_queued`.


        ```json

        {
          "envelopeId": "222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca",
          "purgeState": "documents_and_metadata_queued"
        }

        ```


        To place documents,

        attachments,

        and tabs

        in the purge queue

        and to redact personal information,

        set the `purgeState` property

        to `documents_and_metadata_and_redact_queued`.


        ```json

        {
          "envelopeId": "222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca",
          "purgeState": "documents_and_metadata_and_redact_queued"
        }

        ```


        You can purge documents

        only from completed envelopes

        that are not marked as the authoritative copy.

        The user requesting the purge

        must have permission to purge documents

        and

        must be the sender or be acting on behalf of the sender.


        When the purge request is initiated

        the items to be purged

        are placed in the purge queue

        for deletion in 14 days.

        The sender

        and

        all recipients with DocuSign accounts

        associated with the envelope

        get an email notification

        the documents will be deleted in 14 days.

        The notification contains a link

        to the documents.

        A second email notification

        is sent 7 days later.

        At the end of the 14-day period

        the documents are deleted from the system.

        Recipients without DocuSign accounts

        do not receive email notifications.


        If your account has a Document Retention policy,

        envelope documents

        are automatically placed

        in the purge queue,

        and notification emails are sent

        at the end of the retention period.

        Setting a Document Retention policy is the same as setting a

        schedule for purging documents.


        ## Removing documents from the purge queue


        To remove documents from the purge queue, include the following code in
        the request body:


        ```json

        {
          "envelopeId": "222e6847-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72a3c9c16fca",
          "purgeState": "documents_dequeued"
        }

        ```

        Envelope attachments are files that an application can include in an
        envelope. They are not converted to PDF. Envelope attachments are
        available only through the API. There is no user interface in the
        DocuSign web application for them.

        Retrieves the custom field information for the specified envelope. You
        can use these fields in the envelopes for your account to record
        information about the envelope, help search for envelopes, and track
        information. The envelope custom fields are shown in the Envelope
        Settings section when a user is creating an envelope in the DocuSign
        member console. The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope
        recipients.


        There are two types of envelope custom fields, text, and list. A text
        custom field lets the sender enter the value for the field. With a list
        custom field, the sender selects the value of the field from a pre-made
        list.

        **Note:** When adding or modifying documents for an in-process envelope,

        DocuSign recommends

        [locking the envelope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        prior to making any changes.


        If the file name of a document contains Unicode characters, you need to
        include a `Content-Disposition` header. Example:



        **Header:** `Content-Disposition`



        **Value:** `file; filename=\"name\";fileExtension=ext;documentId=1`
      parameters:

        To delete a document, use only the relevant parts of the
        [`envelopeDefinition`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).

        For example, this request body specifies that you want to delete the
        document whose `documentId` is "1".



        ```text

        {
          "documents": [
            {
              "documentId": "1"
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        The envelope status must be one of:


        - `created`

        - `sent`

        - `delivered`


      parameters:

      summary: Retrieves a single document or all documents from an envelope.
      operationId: Documents_GetDocument
      description: >
        Retrieves a single document or all documents from an envelope.


        To retrieve a single document, provide the ID of the document in the
        `documentId` path parameter.

        Alternatively, by setting the `documentId` parameter to special keyword
        values,

        you can retrieve all the documents (as a combined PDF, portfolio PDF, or
        ZIP archive)

        or just the certificate of completion. See the `documentId` description
        for how to retrieve each format.



        The response body of this method

        is a file. If you request multiple documents,

        the result is a ZIP archive

        that contains all of the documents.


        In all other cases, the response is a PDF

        file or PDF portfolio.



        You can get the file name and document ID from the response's
        `Content-Disposition` header:


        ```

        Content-Disposition: file; filename="NDA.pdf"; documentid="1

        ```


        By default, the response is the PDF file

        as a byte stream.

        For example a request/response in `curl` looks like this:


        ```

        $ curl --request GET
        'https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2/accounts/0cdb3ff3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-e43af011006d/envelopes/ea4cc25b-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-a67a0a2a4f6c/documents/1/'
        \
               --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ...bqg'


        HTTP/1.1 200 OK

        Content-Length: 167539

        Content-Type: application/pdf

        . . .

        Content-Disposition: file; filename="Lorem_Ipsum.pdf"; documentid="1"

        Date: Tue, 23 Aug 2022 01:13:15 GMT


        %PDF-1.4

        %˚¸˝˛

        6 0 obj

        <</Length 14>>stream

        . . .

        ```


        By using the `Content-Transfer-Encoding`

        header in the request, you can obtain the PDF file

        encoded in base64. The same `curl` request with

        the base64 header would look like this:


        ```

        $ curl --request GET
        'https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2/accounts/0cdb3ff3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-e43af011006d/envelopes/ea4cc25b-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-a67a0a2a4f6c/documents/1/'
        \
               --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ...bqg' \
               --header 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64'


        HTTP/1.1 200 OK

        Content-Length: 223384

        Content-Type: application/pdf

        . . .

        Content-Disposition: file; filename="Lorem_Ipsum.pdf"; documentid="1"

        Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

        Date: Tue, 23 Aug 2022 01:12:30 GMT


        JVBERi0xLjQKJfv8/f4KNiAwIG9iago8PC9MZW. . .==

        ```



        (In an actual `curl` request you would use the `--output` switch to

        save the byte stream into a file.)

        Adds or replaces a document in an existing draft or in-process envelope.

        An in-process envelope is one that has been sent but not yet completed
        or voided.



        **Note:** When adding or modifying documents for an in-process envelope,

        DocuSign recommends

        [locking the envelope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        prior to making any changes.


        To add a new document, set the `documentId` path parameter to a new
        document ID.


        To replace a document, set the `documentId` path parameter to the
        document ID of the existing document.

        The tabs of the original document will be applied to the new document.

        For example, a request in cURL looks like this:


        ```

        $ curl --location --request PUT
        'https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2.1/accounts/0cdb3ff3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-e43af011006d/envelopes/ea4cc25b-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-a67a0a2a4f6c/documents/1'

            --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ...bqg' \
            --header 'Content-Disposition: filename="newDocument"' \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/pdf' \
            --data-binary '@/location/of/document.pdf'

            Unlike other IDs in the eSignature API,
            you specify the `documentId` yourself.
            Typically the first document has the ID

            but you can use any numbering scheme
            that fits within a 32-bit signed integer
            (1 through 2147483647).

      description: >-
        Creates a preview of the

        [responsive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        HTML version of a specific document.

        This method enables you to preview a PDF document

        conversion to responsive HTML across device types prior to sending.


        The request body is a `documentHtmlDefinition` object, which holds the
        responsive signing parameters that define how to generate the HTML
        version of the signing document.
      parameters:
        - description: The external account number (int) or account ID GUID.

        - description: |
            The unique ID of the document within the envelope.

            Unlike other IDs in the eSignature API,
            you specify the `documentId` yourself.
            Typically the first document has the ID
            `1`, the second document `2`, and so on,
            but you can use any numbering scheme
            that fits within a 32-bit signed integer
            (1 through 2147483647).

            Unlike other IDs in the eSignature API,
            you specify the `documentId` yourself.
            Typically the first document has the ID
            `1`, the second document `2`, and so on,
            but you can use any numbering scheme
            that fits within a 32-bit signed integer
            (1 through 2147483647).


            Tab objects have a `documentId` property
            that specifies the document on which to place
            the tab.

        additional signer authentication options.

        and can be specified in either JSON or XML.


        **JSON**

        ```

        {
          "LockToken": "token-from-response",
          "LockDurationInSeconds": "600"
        }

        ```


        **XML**

        ```

        <DocuSignEdit>
          <LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken>
          <LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds>
        </DocuSignEdit>

        ```


        In the actual HTTP header, you would remove the linebreaks:


        ```

        X-DocuSign-Edit: {"LockToken": "token-from-response",
        "LockDurationInSeconds": "600" }
            or
        X-DocuSign-Edit:<DocuSignEdit><LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken><LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds></DocuSignEdit>

        ```

      operationId: Recipients_PutRecipients
      description: >+
        Updates the recipients of a draft envelope or corrects recipient
        information for an in-process envelope.


        If you send information for a recipient that does not already

        exist in a draft envelope, the recipient is added to the envelope

        (similar to the [EnvelopeRecipients: Create][EnvelopeRecipients-create]
        method).


        You can also use this method to resend an envelope to a recipient

        by using the `resend_envelope` option.


        **Updating Sent Envelopes**


        After an envelope has been sent, you can edit only the following
        properties:


        - `accessCode`

        - `agentCanEditName`

        - `agentCanEditEmail`

        - `customFields`

        - `deliveryMethod`

        - `documentVisibility`

        - `email` (If you provide an email address in this method, it will be
        treated as a new email address, even if it is exactly the same as the
        current address. Do not provide an email address if you do not want a
        correction email sent.)

        - `emailNotification`

        - `idCheckConfigurationName`

        - `identityVerification`

        - `name`

        - `note`

        - `phoneAuthentication`

        - `recipientType` (For this to work, you must also change the recipient
        object to match the recipient type.)

        - `requireIdLookup`

        - `routingOrder`

        - `routingOrder`

        - `signingGroupId` (You can change this ID to switch to a different
        signing group and its corresponding set of recipients.)

        - `smsAuthentication`

        - `suppressEmails`

        - `userName`


        If the recipient has signed,

        but the envelope is still active,

        the method will return success,

        but the `recipientUpdateResults` property

        in the response will include an error

        that the recipient could not be updated:


        ```

        {
          "recipientUpdateResults": [
            {
              "recipientId": "999",
              "errorDetails": {
                "errorCode": "RECIPIENT_UPDATE_FAILED",
                "message": "The recipient could not be updated.  Recipient not in state that allows correction."
              }
            }
          ]
        }

        ```

      description: >-
        Retrieves the initials image for the specified user. The image is
        returned in the same format as it was uploaded. In the request you can
        specify if the chrome (the added line and identifier around the initial
        image) is returned with the image.


        The userId specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's
        user ID and the user must be a member of the account.


        The `signatureIdOrName` parameter accepts signature ID or signature
        name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since
        some names contain characters that do not properly URL encode. If you
        use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces and you
        might need to URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint.


        For example: "Bob Smith" to "Bob%20Smith"


        Older envelopes might only contain chromed images. If getting the
        non-chromed image fails, try getting the chromed image.

      operationId: Recipients_GetRecipientSignatureImage
      description: >-
        Retrieves the specified user signature image. The image is returned in
        the same format as uploaded. In the request you can specify if the
        chrome (the added line and identifier around the initial image) is
        returned with the image.


        The userId specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's
        user ID and the user must be a member of the account.


        The `signatureIdOrName` parameter accepts signature ID or signature
        name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since
        some names contain characters that don't properly URL encode. If you use
        the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces and you might
        need to URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint. 


        For example: "Bob Smith" to "Bob%20Smith"


        Older envelopes might only have chromed images. If getting the
        non-chromed image fails, try getting the chromed image.

      summary: Returns a URL to the envelope correction UI.
      operationId: Views_PostEnvelopeCorrectView
      description: >
        Returns a URL that allows you to embed the envelope correction view of
        the DocuSign UI. To customize the appearance of the correction view, you
        can add special query parameters to the returned URL when you use it in
        your application.


        You can revoke this URL by calling the
        [deleteEnvelopeCorrectView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) endpoint.


        ## Best practices


        The returned URL expires after 10 minutes and can only be used once.
        Therefore, request the URL immediately before you redirect your user to
        it.


        Due to screen space issues, do not use an `<iframe>` for embedded
        operations on mobile devices. For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using
        a WebView.


        ## Customizing the correction view


        To customize the appearance of the correction view, you can add query
        parameters **to the URL that is returned by this endpoint and used in
        your application.** Do not add these query parameters to the URL of the
        endpoint itself.


        For example, adding the following query parameters to the URL returned
        by this method causes the sending view to:


        - start in the tagging screen

        - hide the Edit Pages command

        - hide all of the options under the Actions dropdown except Save, Close,
        and Discard


        ```

        https://demo.docusign.net/Member/StartInSession.aspx?StartConsole=1&t=dd3b7c4c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-50cd195a3401&DocuEnvelope=f37489d3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4de057063d0e&\
                advcorrect=1&\
                showEditPages=false&\
                showHeaderActions=false
        ```



        The default value reflects what happens

        if you omit the customization query parameter.

        You can use the interactive

        [Embedded Sending Demo
        tool](https://sign.agreementsdemo.com/Home/Sending)

        to see the effect of using different query parameters.

        ##  Modifying the envelope after redirection


        If you use `sendButtonAction=redirect` or `backButtonAction=redirect`,
        and you intend to modify the envelope after redirection, you will need
        to lock the envelope and add an extra query parameter:


        1.  [Create a lock token][createLock] for the envelope.

        2.  Add the new lock token to the URL with the `lockToken` query
        parameter.<br>
            `...&sendButtonAction=redirect&lockToken=MDgxZxabUVBiMWUzZWYz`<br>
            **Note:** The `lockToken` query parameter is case-sensitive.


        After clicking Continue,

        your user is redirected back to your integration.

        You can then [delete the lock token][deleteLock].


        [createLock]:
        /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopelocks/create/

        [deleteLock]:
        /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopelocks/delete/



        ## Information security notice


        This method provides full access to the sending account. When you

        use this view, the current user has full access to the account.

        If the account has administrative privileges, then this method

        also provides administrator access.


        If your use case needs to enable a sender to update a draft

        envelope before it is sent or make other changes, take one of the

        following steps:


        - Configure each sender to have their own individual user account
          to use this API method.
        - Enhance your API integration so that this method is not needed.
          Your integration can create the tabs, recipients,
          and other envelope settings as needed.

        [embed the recipient view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        of the

        DocuSign UI in your applications. If the recipient is a signer,

        then the view will provide the signing ceremony.


        This method is only used with envelopes in the `sent` status.


        <ds-inlinemessage kind="information" markdown="1">

        Due to screen space issues,

        do not use an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> for embedded operations on
        mobile devices.

        For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.

        </ds-inlinemessage>



        ### The returned URL


        The URL returned in this method's response is intended to be used

        immediately to redirect the signer to the recipient view.

        You can open the recipient view

        in the current browser or in a new tab.

        After the signer is redirected to the

        recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system

        periodically or their session will time out.


        <ds-inlinemessage kind="warning" markdown="1">

        The returned URL can be used only once and

        expires after 5 minutes.

        Do not store or email the returned URL.

        </ds-inlinemessage>


        If you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via

        email, the email invitation's URL must be to your application.

        When invoked, your app should request a `recipientView` URL from

        DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.


        ### How to specify the default language


        You can append the `locale`

        query parameter

        to the URL returned by this method

        to specify a language.


        The language for the recipient view

        follows this order or precedence:


        - The language specified by the sender for the recipient.

        - The `locale` parameter appended to the URL.

        - The account language if the signer has a DocuSign account.

        - The language used in a previous signing if the signer is return
        signer.

        - The browser language.


        For example, to set the default language

        to Canadian French, you would add this query parameter

        to the returned URL:


        ```

        ...?locale=fr_CA

        ```



        ## Authentication


        Your application is responsible for authenticating the identity

        of the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the

        following parameters to record how the recipient

        was authenticated.


        - `assertionId`

        - `authenticationInstant`

        - `authenticationMethod`

        - `clientUserId`

        - `securityDomain`


        At a minimum, `authenticationMethod` and `clientUserId` are

        required. The information that you provide is included in the

        envelope's certificate of completion.


        ## Sending to a remote signer


        You can request a signing session for a remote recipient

        who has a DocuSign account.


        Authenticate the request using the recipient's

        credentials, and do not specify a  `clientUserId`.

        This differs from the typical behavior where the

        request is authenticated using the sender's credentials,

        and the recipient has a `clientUserId` defined.




        ## Redirecting back to returnUrl

        After the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign

        redirects the user's browser back to your app via the

        `returnUrl` that you supplied in the request.


        The signer may be redirected through various DocuSign

        subdomains, depending on the region of the account sending the

        envelope. Please consult [Allowlists for DocuSign eSignature
        service](https://www.docusign.com/trust/security/esignature#allowlists-for-docusign-esignature-service)

        in **Security for DocuSign eSignature**

        when setting up your allowlists



        ### The event status parameter


        DocuSign appends an `event` query parameter to the `returnUrl` with the

        outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app can use this event

        parameter to determine the next step for the envelope.

        Do not fetch the envelope status by using

        [Envelopes: get](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        or a similar method because doing so

        will probably hit [request and polling
        limits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).

        <ds-inlinemessage kind="information" markdown="1">

        Because a user can cancel redirection, close their

        browser after signing, or spoof the landing URL,

        you should not rely on the <code>returnUrl</code>

        alone as the single source of truth for envelope

        status for your integration.

        </ds-inlinemessage>


        ### Maintaining State

        After the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing

        ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your

        application can recover state information about the transaction

        by storing information in a cookie, or by including query

        parameters in the `returnUrl` field. For example.

        `https://myapp.example.com/docusign_return?myState=12345` When the

        user is redirected to your app, the `event` query parameter will

        be appended. In this example, prevent spoofing by not using a

        guessable value as the state value.

      description: >
        Returns a URL that enables you to embed the sender view

        of the DocuSign UI in your applications. To customize the appearance of
        the sender view, you can append special query parameters to the returned
        URL. 



        ## Best Practices


        The returned URL can only be redirected to immediately after it

        is generated. It can only be used once. Therefore, request the

        URL immediately before you redirect your user to it.


        Due to screen space issues,

        do not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices.

        For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.


        ## Customizing the sending view


        You can add query parameters

        to customize the appearance of the sending view.

        For example, adding the following query parameters

        to the URL returned by this method

        causes the sending view to:


        - start in the tagging screen

        - hide the Edit Pages command

        - hide all of the options under the Actions dropdown except Save, Close,
        and Discard


        ```

        https://demo.docusign.net/Member/StartInSession.aspx?StartConsole=1&t=dd3b7c4c-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-50cd195a3401&DocuEnvelope=f37489d3-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4de057063d0e&\
                send=1&\
                showEditPages=false&\
                showHeaderActions=false
        ```


        The default value reflects what happens

        if you omit the customization query parameter.

        You can use the interactive

        [Embedded Sending Demo
        tool](https://sign.agreementsdemo.com/Home/Sending)

        to see the effect of using different query parameters.

        ##  Modifying the envelope after redirection


        If you use `sendButtonAction=redirect`

        or

        `backButtonAction=redirect`,

        and

        you intend to modify the envelope after redirection,

        you will need to lock the envelope

        and

        add an extra query parameter:


        1.  [Create a lock token][createLock] for the envelope.

        2.  Add the new lock token to the URL with the `lockToken` query
        parameter.<br>
            `...&sendButtonAction=redirect&lockToken=MDgxZxabUVBiMWUzZWYz`<br>
            **Note:** The `lockToken` query parameter is case-sensitive.


        After clicking Continue,

        your user is redirected back to your integration.

        You can then [delete the lock token][deleteLock].


        [createLock]:
        /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopelocks/create/

        [deleteLock]:
        /docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopelocks/delete/



        ## Information security notice


        This method provides full access to the sending account. When you

        use this view, the current user has full access to the account.

        If the account has administrative privileges, then this method

        also provides administrator access.


        If your use case needs to enable a sender to update a draft

        envelope before it is sent or make other changes, take one of the

        following steps:


        - Configure each sender to have their own individual user account
          to use this API method.
        - Enhance your API integration so that this method is not needed.
          Your integration can create the tabs, recipients,
          and other envelope settings as needed.

        that a recipient on the same account has shared with them.


        Due to screen space issues,

        do not use an `<iframe>` for embedded operations on mobile devices.

        For iOS devices, DocuSign recommends using a WebView.

        You can use this endpoint to add delayed routing to a draft envelope or
        a sent envelope (as long as the previous workflow step has not yet been
        completed). You can also update the delayed routing rule for an
        envelope, as long as the delay is not yet complete. If you update the
        delayed routing rule while the delay is already in progress, the
        countdown will reset.

        Delete the delayed routing object for an envelope's workflow step. You
        cannot call this endpoint once the delay is in progress. As a

        **Note:** After deleting the delayed routing object, the workflow step
        still contains the `pause_before` action. Once the workflow step is
        reached, you will need to [unpause the

        step entirely, use

        | `transaction_ids` | A comma-separated list of transaction IDs<br>or

        When you use the special value `request_body`, the request body looks
        like this:


        ```

          ]
        }

        ```


        <ds-inlinemessage kind="warning">

        Omitting the request body altogether causes the endpoint to return an
        error.

        The request body must be at least <code>{}</code>.

        Groups help you manage users.

        For example, you can use groups

        to limit user access to templates.


        You can associate a group with a

        [permission profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com),

        which sets the user permissions for users in that group

        without having to set the `userSettings` property for each user.

        You are not required to set permission profiles for a group,

        but it makes it easier to manage user permissions

        for a large number of users.



        <ds-inlinemessage kind="warning" markdown="1">

        This endpoint uses only

        the <code>groupName</code> and

        <code>permissionProfileId</code>

        properties in the request body.

        All other properties are ignored.

        </ds-inlinemessage>



        Example request:

        ```json

        {
          "groups": [
            { "groupName": "montagues" },
            { "groupName": "capulets" },
            { "groupName": "nobles",
               "permissionProfileId": 1597 }
          ]
        }

        ```


        Use [AccountPermissionProfiles: list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        to get a list of permission profiles and their IDs.

        It is an error if the `permissionProfileId` does not exist.

        This method creates a new PowerForm.


        You create a PowerForm from an existing DocuSign
        [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com), based on the `templateId`
        in the request body.

         PowerForms that you create from a template are referred to as *web PowerForms*.

        **Note:** The DocuSign Admin console also supports creating a PowerForm
        by uploading a PDF file that has active form fields (referred to as a
        *PDF PowerForm*). However, PDF PowerForms are deprecated and are not
        supported in the API.


        **Note:** A PowerForm can have only one sender. (Because PowerForms are
        not necessarily sent by email, this user is also referred to as the
        PowerForm *initiator*.) If you need to associate multiple senders with a
        PowerForm, create multiple copies of the PowerForm by using the same
        template (one copy for each sender). By default, the sender is the
        PowerForm Administrator who creates the PowerForm.



        ### Signing modes


        You can use one of the following signing modes for a PowerForm:


        **`email`**


        This mode verifies the recipient's identity by using email
        authentication before the recipient can sign a document. The recipient
        enters their email address on the landing page and then clicks **Begin
        Signing** to begin the signing process. The system then sends an email
        message with a validation code to the recipient. If the recipient does
        not provide a valid email address, they do not receive the email message
        containing the access code and are not able to open and sign the
        document.


        Alternatively, you can make the process easier for signers by using
        email authentication only and omitting the access code. To do this, you
        append the `activateonly` flag to the PowerForm URL and set it to true
        by passing in the value `1`.  When the flag is active, the first
        recipient receives an email with a link that initiates the signing
        session without having to enter access code.


        Example: `activateonly=1`


        **`direct`**


        This mode does not require any verification. After a recipient enters
        their email address on the landing page and clicks **Begin Signing,** a
        new browser tab opens and the recipient can immediately begin the
        signing process.


        Because the `direct` signing mode does not verify the recipient's
        identity by using email authentication, we strongly recommend that you
        use this mode only when the PowerForm is accessible behind a secure
        portal where the recipient's identity is already authenticated, or where
        another form of authentication is specified for the recipient in the
        DocuSign template (for example, an access code, phone authentication, or
        ID check).


        **Note:** In the account settings, `enablePowerFormDirect` must be
        **true** to use `direct` as the `signingMode`.


        ### Redirect URLs


        You can control the URL to which signers are redirected after signing
        your PowerForm. However, the URL is specified elsewhere, outside of the
        PowerForm creation process. For details, see [How do I specify a URL to
        redirect to when a PowerForm is
        completed?](https://support.docusign.com/s/articles/How-do-I-specify-a-URL-to-redirect-to-when-a-Powerform-is-completed).

        This sets the shared access status for one or more users or templates.


        When setting user shared access, only users with account administration
        privileges can set shared access status for envelopes.


        When setting template shared access, only users who own a template and
        have sharing permission or with account administration privileges can
        set shared access for templates.


        Changes to the shared items status are not additive. The change always
        replaces the current status.


        To change template shared access, add the query parameter `item_type` =
        `templates` to the request. When this is set, the user and envelopes
        properties are not required.

        individual recipient when creating an envelope, as well as their simple
        type enumeration values. These are the languages that you can set for
        the standard email format and signing view for each recipient.


        For example, in the recipient's email notification, this setting affects
        elements such as the standard introductory text describing the request
        to sign. It also determines the language used for buttons and tabs in
        both the email notification and the signing experience.


        **Note:** Setting a language for a recipient affects only the DocuSign
        standard text. Any custom text that you enter for the `emailBody` and
        `emailSubject` of the notification is not translated, and appears
        exactly as you enter it.

        Email

        [Templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        help streamline the sending process when you frequently

        send the same or similar documents, or send different documents

        to the same group of people.


        When you create a template, you define placeholder roles. Rather

        than specifying a person, you specify a role that regularly

        participates in a transaction that uses the template. Then, when

        you create or send an envelope based on the template, you assign

        actual recipients to the template roles. The recipients

        automatically inherit all of the workflow that is defined for

        that role in the template, such as the tabs and routing

        information.


        ## Template Email Subject Merge Fields


        Placeholder roles have associated merge fields that personalize

        the email notification that DocuSign sends. For example, the

        template automatically personalizes the email message by adding

        placeholders for the recipient's name and email address within

        the email subject line, based on the recipient's role. When the

        sender adds the name and email information for the recipient and

        sends the envelope, the recipient information is automatically

        merged into the appropriate fields in the email subject line.


        Both the sender and the recipients will see the information in

        the email subject line for any emails associated with the

        template. This provides an easy way for senders to organize their

        envelope emails without having to open an envelope to find out

        who the recipient is.




        Use the following placeholders

        to insert a recipient's name or

        email address in the subject line


        To insert a recipient's name into the subject line,

        use the `[[<roleName>_UserName]]` placeholder

        in the  `emailSubject` property when you create the

        template:


        To include a recipient's name

        or email address in the subject line,

        use the following placeholders

        in the `emailSubject` property:


        - `[[<roleName>_UserName]]`

        - `[[<roleName>_Email]]`



        For example, if the role name is `Signer 1`,

        you might set `emailSubject` to one of these strings:


        - `"[[Signer 1_UserName]], Please sign this NDA"`

        - `"[[Signer 1_Email]], Please sign this NDA"`



        **Note:** The maximum length of the

        subject line is 100 characters,

        including any merged text.



        ## Creating multiple templates


        To create multiple templates, you provide a zip file of JSON

        files. You can also use the Templates::ListTemplates method with

        the `is_download` query parameter to download a zip file

        containing your existing templates and use that as a guide. The

        API supports both .zip and .gzip file formats as input.


        You also need to set the

        `Content-Length`,

        `Content-Type`,

        and

        `Content-Disposition`

        headers:



        ```

        Content-Length: 71068

        Content-Type: application/zip

        Content-Disposition: file;
        filename="DocuSignTemplates_Nov_25_2019_20_40_21.zip";
        fileExtension=.zip

        ```

        You must include the `X-DocuSign-Edit` header
        as described in
        [TemplateLocks: create](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).


        Use this method to change the duration
        of the lock (`lockDurationInSeconds`)
        or the `lockedByApp` string.

        The request body is a full `lockRequest` object,
        but you only need to specify the
        properties that you are updating. For example:

        ```
        {
          "lockDurationInSeconds": "3600",
          "lockedByApp": "My Application"
        }

      description: >+
        This method locks the specified template and sets the time until

        the lock expires to prevent other users or recipients from

        changing the template.


        The response to this request includes a `lockToken` parameter

        that you must use in the `X-DocuSign-Edit` header for

        every PUT method (typically a method that updates a template)

        while the template is locked.



        If you do not provide the `lockToken` when accessing

        a locked template, you will get the following

        error:


        ```

        {
           "errorCode": "EDIT_LOCK_NOT_LOCK_OWNER",
           "message": "The user is not the owner of the lock. The template is locked by another user or in another application"
        }

        ```



        ### The X-DocuSign-Edit header


        The `X-DocuSign-Edit` header looks like this

        and can be specified in either JSON or XML.


        **JSON**

        ```

        {
          "LockToken": "token-from-response",
          "LockDurationInSeconds": "600"
        }

        ```


        **XML**

        ```

        <DocuSignEdit>
          <LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken>
          <LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds>
        </DocuSignEdit>

        ```


        In the actual HTTP header, you would remove the linebreaks:


        ```

        X-DocuSign-Edit: {"LockToken": "token-from-response",
        "LockDurationInSeconds": "600" }
            or
        X-DocuSign-Edit:<DocuSignEdit><LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken><LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds></DocuSignEdit>

        ```

        Adds new users to an account. 


        The body of this request is an array of `newUsers` objects. For each new
        user, you must provide at least the `userName` and `email` properties.
        The maximum number of users you can create in one request is 500 users. 


        The `userSettings` property specifies the actions users can perform. In
        the example below, Tal Mason will be able to send envelopes, and the
        activation email will be in French because the `locale` is set to `fr`.



        ```

        POST /restapi/v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/users

        Content-Type: application/json

        ```

        ```

        {
          "newUsers": [
            {
              "userName": "Claire Horace",
              "email": "claire@example.com"
            },
            {
              "userName": "Tal Mason",
              "email": "talmason@example.com",
              "company": "TeleSel",
              "userSettings": {
                "locale": "fr",
                "canSendEnvelope": true
              }
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        A successful response is a `newUsers` array with information about the
        newly created users. If there was a problem in creating a user, that
        user entry will contain an `errorDetails` property that describes what
        went wrong.

      description: >
        Create or update multiple user authorizations in a single request. The
        body of the request is a list of userAuthorizationSomething objects. To
        create a new authorization, specify the `agentUser` and `permission`
        fields, with the optional `startDate` and `endDate` fields. To update an
        existing authorization, specify the `authorizationId` field and the
        `startDate` and/or `endDate` fields.


        For example, to create a new authorization and update the end date of an
        existing authorization, your request body might look like this:


        ```

        {
          "authorizations": [
            {
              "agentUser": {
                "userId": "1470ff66-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-8c46f140da37",
                "accountId": "230546a7-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-af205d5494ad"
              },
              "permission": "manage"
            },
            {
              "authorizationId": "b73ac983-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-b3c0ea5b09d3",
              "endDate": "2023-05-09T21:36:27.0000000+00:00"
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        The principal user is specified by the `userId` path parameter. To call
        this endpoint, you must be an account administrator or the principal
        user.


        **Note:** To create an authorization with signing permission, the
        `AllowDelegationSigning` setting must be enabled on the account. If you
        share signing access, the agent user will receive an email notification.
        Each principal user can only share signing permission with one agent
        user.

        Retrieves a list of custom user settings for a single user.


        Custom settings provide a flexible way to store and retrieve

        custom user information that can be used in your own system.


        **Note:** Custom user settings are not the same as user account

        settings.



        If the custom user settings you want to retrieve are grouped, you

        must include the `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key` header

        in the request:


        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name`


        Where the `group_name` is your designated name for the group of

        customer user settings.


        If the `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key` header is not included, only the
        custom

        user settings that were added without a group are retrieved.

        **Note:** Custom user settings are not the same as user account

        settings.


        Custom settings provide a flexible way to store and retrieve

        custom user information that you can use in your own system.


        **Important:** There is a limit on the size for all the custom

        user settings for a single user. The limit is 4,000 characters,

        which includes the XML and JSON structure for the settings.


        You can group custom user settings when adding them. Grouping

        allows you to retrieve settings that are in a specific group,

        instead of retrieving all the user custom settings.


        To group custom user settings, include the

        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key` header in the request:


        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name`


        Where the `group_name` is your designated name for the group of

        customer user settings.


        When getting or deleting grouped custom user settings, you must

        include the `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key` header information.


        Grouping custom user settings is not required and if the
        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key`

        header information is not included, the custom user settings are

        added normally and can be retrieved or deleted without including

        the `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key` header.

      summary: Adds user Signature and initials images to a Signature.
      operationId: UserSignatures_PostUserSignatures
      description: >-
        Adds a user signature image and/or user initials image to the specified
        user. 


        The userId property specified in the endpoint must match the
        authenticated user's `userId` and the user must be a member of the
        account.


        The rules and processes associated with this are:


        * If `Content-Type` is set to `application/json`, then the default
        behavior for creating a default signature image, based on the name and a
        DocuSign font, is used.

        * If `Content-Type` is set to `multipart/form-data`, then the request
        must contain a first part with the user signature information, followed
        by parts that contain the images.


        For each Image part, the Content-Disposition header has a "filename"
        value that is used to map to the `signatureName` and/or
        `signatureInitials` properties in the JSON to the image. 


        For example: 

        `Content-Disposition: file; filename="Ron Test20121127083900"`


        If no matching image (by filename value) is found, then the image is not
        set. One, both, or neither of the signature and initials images can be
        set with this call.


        The Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 header, set in the header for the
        part containing the image, can be set to indicate that the images are
        formatted as base64 instead of as binary.


        If successful, 200-OK is returned, and a JSON structure containing the
        signature information is provided, note that the signatureId can change
        with each API POST, PUT, or DELETE since the changes to the signature
        structure cause the current signature to be closed, and a new signature
        record to be created.

        The `signatureId` parameter accepts a signature ID or a signature name.
        DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since some
        names contain characters that do not properly encode into a URL. If you
        use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces. In that
        case, URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint. 


        For example encode "Bob Smith" as "Bob%20Smith".

        The following restrictions apply:


        - The current user must be a notary.

        - The `jurisdictionId` path parameter must be a jurisdiction that the
        notary is registered for.

        - The `jurisdictionId` path parameter must match the request body's
        `jurisdiction.jurisdictionId`.


        The request body must have a full `jurisdiction` object for the
        jurisdiction property.

        The best way to do this is to use `getNotaryJurisdiction` to obtain the
        current values and update the properties you want to change.


        For example, assume `getNotaryJurisdiction` returns this:


        ```

        {
            "jurisdiction": {
                "jurisdictionId": "15",
                "name": "Iowa",
                "county": "",
                "enabled": "true",
                "countyInSeal": "false",
                "commissionIdInSeal": "true",
                "stateNameInSeal": "true",
                "notaryPublicInSeal": "true",
                "allowSystemCreatedSeal": "true",
                "allowUserUploadedSeal": "false"
            },
            "commissionId": "123456",
            "commissionExpiration": "2020-08-31T07:00:00.0000000Z",
            "registeredName": "Bob Notary",
            "county": "Adams",
            "sealType": "system_created"
        }

        ```


        If you want to change the name of the notary from "Bob Notary" to
        "Robert Notary", your request body would be:


        ```

        {
            "jurisdiction": {
                "jurisdictionId": "15",
                "name": "Iowa",
                "county": "",
                "enabled": "true",
                "countyInSeal": "false",
                "commissionIdInSeal": "true",
                "stateNameInSeal": "true",
                "notaryPublicInSeal": "true",
                "allowSystemCreatedSeal": "true",
                "allowUserUploadedSeal": "false"
            },
            "commissionId": "123456",
            "commissionExpiration": "2020-08-31T07:00:00.0000000Z",
            "registeredName": "Robert Notary",
            "county": "Adams",
            "sealType": "system_created"

        When enabled (`apiRequestLogging` is **true**),

        REST API requests and responses for the user are added to a log.

        A log can have up to 50 requests/responses

        and the current number of log entries can be determined

        by getting the settings.

        Logging is automatically disabled when the log limit of 50 is reached.


        You can call

        [Diagnostics: getRequestLog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        or

        [Diagnostics: listRequestLogs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        to download the log files (individually or as a zip file).

        Call [Diagnostics: deleteRequestLogs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

        to clear the log by deleting current entries.


        Private information, such as passwords and integration key information,

        which is normally located in the call header is omitted from the
        request/response log.


        API request logging only captures requests from the authenticated user.

        Any call that does not authenticate the user and resolve a userId is not
        logged.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

        authenticationCheck:

            - Phone Authentication

            - SMS Authentication

            - Knowledge-Based ID


            This setting takes one of the following options: 


            - `initial_access`: The authentication check always applies the
            first time a recipient accesses the documents. Recipients are not
            asked to authenticate again when they access the documents from the
            same browser on the same device. If the recipient attempts to access
            the documents from a different browser or a different device, the
            recipient must pass authentication again. Once authenticated, that
            recipient is not challenged again on the new device or browser. The
            ability for a recipient to skip authentication for documents is
            limited to documents sent from the same sending account.

            - `each_access`: Authentication checks apply every time a recipient
            attempts to access the envelope. However, you can configure the
            Authentication Expiration setting to allow recipients to skip
            authentication when they have recently passed authentication by
            setting a variable time frame.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?
            [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            `enforceSignerVisibility` property must be set to **true** for the
            envelope to use this.


            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can
            only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document.
            Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or
            Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or
            Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope,
            unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an
            envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible
            to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this
            setting when an envelope is sent.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets.

            - `ID Check $`: The  recipient must answer detailed security
            questions.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?
            [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

        excludedDocuments:
          description: >-
            Specifies the documents that are not visible to this recipient.
            Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the
            `enforceSignerVisibility` property must be set to **true** for the
            envelope to use this.


            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can
            only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document.
            Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or
            Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or
            Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope,
            unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an
            envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible
            to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this
            setting when an envelope is sent.

            - `SMS Auth $`: The recipient must authenticate via SMS. You provide
            the phone number to use in the `smsAuthentication` object.

            - `ID Check $`: The  recipient must answer detailed security
            questions.

            available. In the web console Identify list, these appear as ID
            Check $ and SMS Auth $. To use ID Check in an envelope, the
            idCheckConfigurationName should be ID Check $. For SMS, you would

            the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing
            order.

            - `certifiedDelivery`: Certified delivery recipients must receive
            the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. They don't
            need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the
            documents.

            - `editor`: Editors have the same management and access rights for
            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name
            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that
            the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?
            [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            `enforceSignerVisibility` property must be set to **true** for the
            envelope to use this.


            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can
            only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document.
            Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or
            Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or
            Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope,
            unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an
            envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible
            to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this
            setting when an envelope is sent.

            recipients that appear after the agent in routing order.

            - `carbonCopy`: Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope
            but don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of
            the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing
            order.

            - `certifiedDelivery`: Certified delivery recipients must receive
            the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. They don't
            need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the

            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name
            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that
            the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.

            Valid values:


            - `autoresponded`: The recipient's email system auto-responded to
            the email from DocuSign. This status is used in the web console to
            inform senders about the bounced-back email. This recipient status
            is only used if **Send-on-behalf-of** is turned off for the account.

            - `completed`: The recipient has completed their actions (signing or
            other required actions if not a signer) for an envelope.

            - `created`: The recipient is in a draft state. This value is only
            associated with draft envelopes (envelopes that have a status of
            `created`).

            - `declined`: The recipient declined to sign the documents in the
            envelope.

            - `delivered`: The recipient has viewed the documents in an envelope
            through the DocuSign signing website. This is not an email delivery
            of the documents in an envelope.

            - `faxPending`: The recipient has finished signing and the system is
            waiting for a fax attachment from the recipient before completing
            their signing step.

            - `sent`: The recipient has been sent an email notification that it
            is their turn to sign an envelope.

            - `signed`: The recipient has completed (signed) all required tags
            in an envelope. This is a temporary state during processing, after
            which the recipient's status automatically switches to `completed`.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man`
            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/propertyMetadata'
        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor
            tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man`
            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.
            When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`,
            `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            When using any of [the legacy event message

            model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com), use the `events`

            When **true,** event delivery acknowledgements are enabled for your
            Connect configuration.


            DocuSign Connect awaits a valid 200 response from your application
            acknowledging that it received a message. If you do not acknowledge
            receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign
            treats the message as a failure and places it into a failure queue.
            It is imperative that you acknowledge successful receipt of Connect
            events as they occur by sending a 200 event back.


            #### When **true** and Send Individual Messages (SIM) mode is
            activated


            If the HTTP status response to a notification message is not in the
            range of 200-299,

            then the message delivery failed, and the configuration is marked as
            down.


            The message will be queued and retried once per day.

            While a Connect configuration is marked down, subsequent
            notifications will not be tried. Instead they will be immediately
            queued with the reason `Pending`.

            When a message succeeds, all queued messages for the configuration
            will be tried immediately, in order.


            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use
            **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the
            notification.


            #### When **true** and SIM mode is not activated


            If the HTTP Status response to a notification message is not in the
            range of 200-299,  then the message delivery failed, and the message
            is queued.


            The message will be retried after at least a day the next time a
            subsequent message is successfully sent to this configuration
            (subscription).  Subsequent notifications will be tried when they
            occur.

            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use
            **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the
            notification.


            #### When **false**


            When `requiresAcknowledgement` is set to **false** and you do not
            acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100
            seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and determines
            that the server is unavailable. It does not retry to send the
            notification message, and you must handle the failure manually.

        entering the date as MM/DD/YYYY, but this is not enforced.
        The format entered by the signer is retained. If you need a

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/propertyMetadata'
        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the value of
            the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor
            tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man`
            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.
            When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`,
            `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?

            the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing
            order.

            - `certifiedDelivery`: Certified delivery recipients must receive
            the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. They don't
            need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the
            documents.

            - `editor`: Editors have the same management and access rights for
            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name
            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that
            the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.

            Valid values:


            - `autoresponded`: The recipient's email system auto-responded to
            the email from DocuSign. This status is used in the web console to
            inform senders about the bounced-back email. This recipient status
            is only used if **Send-on-behalf-of** is turned off for the account.

            - `completed`: The recipient has completed their actions (signing or
            other required actions if not a signer) for an envelope.

            - `created`: The recipient is in a draft state. This value is only
            associated with draft envelopes (envelopes that have a status of
            `created`).

            - `declined`: The recipient declined to sign the documents in the
            envelope.

            - `delivered`: The recipient has viewed the documents in an envelope
            through the DocuSign signing website. This is not an email delivery
            of the documents in an envelope.

            - `faxPending`: The recipient has finished signing and the system is
            waiting for a fax attachment from the recipient before completing
            their signing step.

            - `sent`: The recipient has been sent an email notification that it
            is their turn to sign an envelope.

            - `signed`: The recipient has completed (signed) all required tags
            in an envelope. This is a temporary state during processing, after
            which the recipient's status automatically switches to `completed`.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

        A complex element that allows  the sender to override some envelope
        email setting information. This can be used to override the Reply To

        BCC email addresses to which an envelope is sent. 


        When the emailSettings information is used for an envelope, it only

        **IMPORTANT:** The emailSettings information is not returned in the GET
        for envelope status. Use GET /email_settings to return information about
        the emailSettings. 


        EmailSettings consists of: 


        * replyEmailAddressOverride - The Reply To email used for the envelope.
        DocuSign will verify that a correct email format is used, but does not
        verify that the email is active. Maximum Length: 100 characters.

        * replyEmailNameOverride - The name associated with the Reply To email
        address. Maximum Length: 100 characters.

        the envelope is sent to as a BCC email. Only users with canManageAccount
        setting set to true can use this option. 

        DocuSign verifies that the email format is correct, but does not verify
        that the email is active. Using this overrides the BCC for Email Archive
        information setting for this envelope. Maximum Length: 100 characters.

        *Example*: if your account has BCC for Email Archive set up for the
        email address 'archive@mycompany.com' and you send an envelope using the
        BCC Email Override to send a BCC email to 'salesarchive@mycompany.com',

        * replyEmailNameOverride - The name associated with the Reply To email
        address. Maximum Length: 100 characters.

        * bccEmailAddresses - An array of up to five email addresses to which
        the envelope is sent to as a BCC email. Only users with canManageAccount
        setting set to true can use this option. 

        DocuSign verifies that the email format is correct, but does not verify
        that the email is active. Using this overrides the BCC for Email Archive
        information setting for this envelope. Maximum Length: 100 characters.

        *Example*: if your account has BCC for Email Archive set up for the
        email address 'archive@mycompany.com' and you send an envelope using the
        BCC Email Override to send a BCC email to 'salesarchive@mycompany.com',
        then a copy of the envelope is only sent to the
        'salesarchive@mycompany.com' email address.

            * `email`: The recipient's email address.

            * `name`: The recipient's name.

            * `roleName`: The template roleName associated with the recipient.

            * `clientUserId`: An optional property that specifies whether the
            recipient is embedded or remote. If the `clientUserId` is not null,
            then the recipient is embedded. Note that if a `clientUserId` is

            default recipient and any tabs generated by the `transformPdfFields`
            option are mapped to this recipient.

            * `routingOrder`: This specifies the routing order of the recipient
            in the envelope.

            recipient has to enter to validate the identity. Maximum Length: 50
            characters.

            * `inPersonSignerName`: Optional. If the template role is an

            Length: 100 characters.

            * `emailNotification`: This is an optional complex element that has
            a role-specific `emailSubject`, `emailBody`, and `language`. It
            follows the same format as the `emailNotification` property for
            recipients.

        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharacters:
          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/propertyMetadata'
        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.
            When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`,
            `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

        When the recipient completes the underlying fields,

        the formula tab calculates and displays the result.


        The `formula` property of the tab

        contains the references

        to the underlying tabs.

        See [Calculated Fields][calculatedfields]

        in the DocuSign Support Center

        to learn more about formulas.


        If a formula tab contains

        a `paymentDetails` property,

        the tab is considered a payment item.

        See [Requesting Payments Along with Signatures][paymentguide]

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man`
            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.
            When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`,

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,

            enclosed in brackets,

            to refer to it.


            For example,

            you want to present the total cost

            of two items, tax included.


            The cost of each item is stored

            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.

            The tax rate is in a number tab

            labeled TaxRate.


            The formula string for this property

            would be:

            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

        number or date tabs in the document.

        When the recipient completes the underlying fields,

        the formula tab calculates and displays the result.


        The `formula` property of the tab

        contains the references

        If a formula tab contains

        a `paymentDetails` property,

        the tab is considered a payment item.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/propertyMetadata'
        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man`
            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.

            - `na`: Used when the `status` property is not applicable to the tab
            type. (For example, a tab that has the `tabType`
            `SignerAttachmentOptional`).

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?
            [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            `enforceSignerVisibility` property must be set to **true** for the
            envelope to use this.


            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can
            only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document.
            Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or
            Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or
            Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope,
            unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an
            envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible
            to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this
            setting when an envelope is sent.

            - `carbonCopy`: Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope
            but don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of
            the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing
            order.

            need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the
            documents.

            - `editor`: Editors have the same management and access rights for
            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name
            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that
            the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?
            [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            Specifies the documents that are not visible to this recipient.
            Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the
            `enforceSignerVisibility` property must be set to **true** for the
            envelope to use this.


            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can
            only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document.
            Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or
            Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or
            Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope,
            unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an
            envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible
            to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this
            setting when an envelope is sent.

            but don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of
            the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing
            order.

            - `certifiedDelivery`: Certified delivery recipients must receive
            the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. They don't
            need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the
            documents.

            - `editor`: Editors have the same management and access rights for
            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name
            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that
            the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/propertyMetadata'
        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`,
            `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?

            interface in the Identify list for a recipient. This setting
            overrides any default authentication setting. Valid values are:


            - `Phone Auth $`: The recipient must authenticate by using
            two-factor authentication (2FA). You provide the phone number to use
            for 2FA in the `phoneAuthentication` object.

            - `SMS Auth $`: The recipient must authenticate via SMS. You provide
            the phone number to use in the `smsAuthentication` object.

            - `ID Check $`: The  recipient must answer detailed security
            questions. 


            **Example:** Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication
            available. In the web console Identify list, these appear as ID
            Check $ and SMS Auth $. To use ID Check in an envelope, the

            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that
            the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.

            Valid values:


            - `autoresponded`: The recipient's email system auto-responded to
            the email from DocuSign. This status is used in the web console to
            inform senders about the bounced-back email. This recipient status
            is only used if **Send-on-behalf-of** is turned off for the account.

            - `completed`: The recipient has completed their actions (signing or
            other required actions if not a signer) for an envelope.

            - `created`: The recipient is in a draft state. This value is only
            associated with draft envelopes (envelopes that have a status of
            `created`).

            - `declined`: The recipient declined to sign the documents in the
            envelope.

            - `delivered`: The recipient has viewed the documents in an envelope
            through the DocuSign signing website. This is not an email delivery
            of the documents in an envelope.

            - `faxPending`: The recipient has finished signing and the system is
            waiting for a fax attachment from the recipient before completing
            their signing step.

            - `sent`: The recipient has been sent an email notification that it
            is their turn to sign an envelope.

            - `signed`: The recipient has completed (signed) all required tags
            in an envelope. This is a temporary state during processing, after
            which the recipient's status automatically switches to `completed`.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?
            [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            `enforceSignerVisibility` property must be set to **true** for the
            envelope to use this.


            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can
            only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document.
            Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or
            Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or
            Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope,
            unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an
            envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible
            to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this
            setting when an envelope is sent.

            for 2FA in the `phoneAuthentication` object.

            - `SMS Auth $`: The recipient must authenticate via SMS. You provide
            the phone number to use in the `smsAuthentication` object.

            - `ID Check $`: The  recipient must answer detailed security
            questions.

            available. In the web console Identify list, these appear as ID
            Check $ and SMS Auth $. To use ID Check in an envelope, the
            idCheckConfigurationName should be ID Check $. For SMS, you would

            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name
            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            for calculating the value of

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,

            enclosed in brackets,

            to refer to it.


            For example,

            you want to present the total cost

            of two items, tax included.


            The cost of each item is stored

            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.

            The tax rate is in a number tab

            labeled TaxRate.


            The formula string for this property

            would be:

            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets.

            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?

            for 2FA in the `phoneAuthentication` object.

            - `SMS Auth $`: The recipient must authenticate via SMS. You provide
            the phone number to use in the `smsAuthentication` object.

            - `ID Check $`: The  recipient must answer detailed security
            questions. 


            **Example:** Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication
            available. In the web console Identify list, these appear as ID
            Check $ and SMS Auth $. To use ID Check in an envelope, the
            idCheckConfigurationName should be ID Check $. For SMS, you would

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man`

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/propertyMetadata'
        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            - `email`: Verifies the recipient's identity using email
            authentication before the recipient can sign a document. The
            recipient enters their email address and then clicks **Begin
            Signing** to begin the signing process. The system then sends an
            email message with a validation code for the PowerForm to the
            recipient. If the recipient does not provide a valid email address,
            they cannot open and sign the document.  

            - `direct`: Does not require any verification. After a recipient
            enters their email address and clicks **Begin Signing,** a new
            browser tab opens and the recipient can immediately begin the
            signing process. Because the recipient's identity is not verified by
            using email authentication, we strongly recommend that you only use
            the `direct` signing mode when the PowerForm is accessible behind a
            secure portal where the recipient's identity is already
            authenticated, or where another form of authentication is specified
            for the recipient in the DocuSign template (for example, an access
            code, phone authentication, or ID check).  


            **Note:** In the account settings, `enablePowerFormDirect` must be

            interface in the Identify list for a recipient. This setting
            overrides any default authentication setting. Valid values are:


            - `Phone Auth $`: The recipient must authenticate by using
            two-factor authentication (2FA). You provide the phone number to use
            for 2FA in the `phoneAuthentication` object.

            - `SMS Auth $`: The recipient must authenticate via SMS. You provide
            the phone number to use in the `smsAuthentication` object.

            - `ID Check $`: The  recipient must answer detailed security
            questions. 


            **Example:** Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication
            available. In the web console Identify list, these appear as ID
            Check $ and SMS Auth $. To use ID Check in an envelope, the
            idCheckConfigurationName should be ID Check $. For SMS, you would
            use SMS Auth $, and you would also need to add a phone number to the

            recipients that appear after the agent in routing order.

            - `carbonCopy`: Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope
            but don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of
            the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing
            order.

            - `certifiedDelivery`: Certified delivery recipients must receive
            the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. They don't
            need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the
            documents.

            - `editor`: Editors have the same management and access rights for
            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            A Checkbox tab enables the recipient to select a yes/no (on/off)
            option. This value can be set.

            A Date tab enables the recipient to enter a date. This value can't
            be set. The tooltip for this tab recommends the date format
            MM/DD/YYYY, but several other date formats are also accepted. The
            system retains the format that the recipient enters.


            **Note:** If you need to enforce a specific date format, DocuSign
            recommends that you use a Text tab with a validation pattern and
            validation message.

            An Email tab enables the recipient to enter an email address.

            This is a one-line field that checks that a valid email

            address is entered. It uses the same parameters as a Text

            tab, with the validation message and pattern set for email

            information. This value can be set.


            When getting information that includes

            this tab type, the original value of the tab when the

            associated envelope was sent is included in the response.

            A Radio Group tab places a group of radio buttons on a document. The
            `radios` property is used to add and place the radio

            buttons associated with the group. Only one radio button can be

            enter a Social Security Number (SSN) with or without

            dashes. It uses the same parameters as a Text tab, with the
            validation message and pattern set for SSN information. This value

            can be five digits or nine digits ( in ZIP+4 format), and can be
            entered with or without dashes. It uses the same parameters as a

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            When DocuSign redirects to

            this URL, it will include an `event` query parameter that your app
            can use:


            * `access_code_failed`: Recipient used incorrect access code.

            * `cancel`: Recipient canceled the signing operation,
              possibly by using the **Finish Later** option.
            * `decline`: Recipient declined to sign.

            * `exception`: A system error occurred during the signing process.

            * `fax_pending`: Recipient has a fax pending.

            * `id_check_failed`: Recipient failed an ID check.

            * `session_timeout`: The session timed out. An account can control
            this timeout by using the **Signer Session Timeout** option.

            * `signing_complete`: The recipient completed the signing ceremony.

            * `ttl_expired`: The Time To Live token for the envelope has
            expired.
              After being successfully invoked, these tokens expire
              after five minutes.
            * `viewing_complete`: The recipient completed viewing an envelope
              that is in a read-only/terminal state,
              such as completed, declined, or voided.

        Specifies one or more electronic seals to apply on documents. An
        electronic seal recipient is a legal entity rather than an actual
        person. Electronic Seals can be used by organizations and governments to
        show evidence of origin and integrity of documents. Even though
        electronic seals can be represented by a tab in a document, they do not
        require user interaction and apply automatically in the order specified
        by the sender. The sender is therefore the person authorizing usage of
        the electronic seal in the flow.


        Example:


        ```json

        "recipients": {
              "seals": [
                {
                  "recipientId": "1",
                  "routingOrder" : 1,
                  "recipientSignatureProviders": [
                    {
                      "sealName": "52e9d968-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4682bc45c106"

            The recipient type, as specified by the following values:

            - `agent`: Agent recipients can add name and email information for
            recipients that appear after the agent in routing order.

            - `carbonCopy`: Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope
            but don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of
            the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing
            order.

            - `certifiedDelivery`: Certified delivery recipients must receive
            the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. They don't
            need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the
            documents.

            - `editor`: Editors have the same management and access rights for
            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name
            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that
            the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.

            - `autoresponded`: The recipient's email system auto-responded to
            the email from DocuSign. This status is used in the web console to
            inform senders about the bounced-back email. This recipient status
            is only used if **Send-on-behalf-of** is turned off for the account.

            - `completed`: The recipient has completed their actions (signing or
            other required actions if not a signer) for an envelope.

            - `created`: The recipient is in a draft state. This value is only
            associated with draft envelopes (envelopes that have a status of
            `created`).

            - `declined`: The recipient declined to sign the documents in the
            envelope.

            - `delivered`: The recipient has viewed the documents in an envelope
            through the DocuSign signing website. This is not an email delivery
            of the documents in an envelope.

            - `faxPending`: The recipient has finished signing and the system is
            waiting for a fax attachment from the recipient before completing
            their signing step.

            - `sent`: The recipient has been sent an email notification that it
            is their turn to sign an envelope.

            - `signed`: The recipient has completed (signed) all required tags
            in an envelope. This is a temporary state during processing, after
            which the recipient's status automatically switches to `completed`.

        Specifies one or more electronic seals to apply on documents. An
        electronic seal recipient is a legal entity rather than an actual
        person. Electronic Seals can be used by organizations and governments to
        show evidence of origin and integrity of documents. Even though
        electronic seals can be represented by a tab in a document, they do not
        require user interaction and apply automatically in the order specified
        by the sender. The sender is therefore the person authorizing usage of
        the electronic seal in the flow.


        Example:


        ```json

        "recipients": {
              "seals": [
                {
                  "recipientId": "1",
                  "routingOrder" : 1,
                  "recipientSignatureProviders": [
                    {
                      "sealName": "52e9d968-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-4682bc45c106"
                    }
                ]
              }
            ]
          },
            .

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?
            [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            `enforceSignerVisibility` property must be set to **true** for the
            envelope to use this.


            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can
            only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document.
            Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or
            Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or
            Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope,
            unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an
            envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible
            to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this
            setting when an envelope is sent.

            The recipient type, as specified by the following values:

            - `agent`: Agent recipients can add name and email information for
            recipients that appear after the agent in routing order.

            - `carbonCopy`: Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope
            but don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of
            the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing
            order.

            - `certifiedDelivery`: Certified delivery recipients must receive
            the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. They don't
            need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the
            documents.

            - `editor`: Editors have the same management and access rights for
            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name
            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that
            the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.

            This property is read-only. Possible values are:


            - `created`: The recipient is in a draft state. This is only
            associated with draft envelopes (envelopes with a created status).

            - `sent`: The recipient has been sent an email notification that it
            is their turn to sign an envelope.

            - `delivered`: The recipient has viewed the documents in an envelope
            through the DocuSign signing web site. This is not an email delivery
            of the documents in an envelope.

            - `signed`; The recipient has completed (performed all required
            interactions, such as signing or entering data) all required tags in
            an envelope. This is a temporary state during processing, after
            which the recipient is automatically moved to completed.

            - `declined`: The recipient declined to sign the documents in the
            envelope.

            - `completed`: The recipient has completed their actions (signing or
            other required actions if not a signer) for an envelope.

            - `faxpending`: The recipient has finished signing and the system is
            waiting a fax attachment by the recipient before completing their
            signing step.

            - `autoresponded`: The recipient's email system auto-responded to
            the email from DocuSign. This status is used by the DocuSign webapp
            (also known as the DocuSign console) to inform senders about the

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            matching anchor word.

            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the

            setting. These are the languages that you can set for the standard
            email format and signing view for each recipient.


            For example, in the recipient's email notification, this setting
            affects elements such as the standard introductory text describing
            the request to sign. It also determines the language used for
            buttons and tabs in both the email notification and the signing
            experience.


            **Note:** Setting a language for a recipient affects only the
            DocuSign standard text. Any custom text that you enter for the
            `emailBody` and `emailSubject` of the notification is not
            translated, and appears exactly as you enter it.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in
            relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :


            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man`
            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.

            in your app. Authenticating the user is the responsibility of your
            app when you use embedded signing.


            If the `clientUserId` property is set and either
            `SignerMustHaveAccount` or `SignerMustLoginToSign` property of the

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?

            number or date tabs in the document. When the recipient completes
            the underlying fields, the Formula tab calculates and displays the
            result. This value can be set.


            The `formula` property of the tab contains the references to the
            underlying tabs. To learn more about formulas, see [Calculated
            Fields][calculatedfields].


            If a Formula tab contains a `paymentDetails` property, the tab is
            considered a payment item. To learn more about payments, see
            [Requesting Payments Along with Signatures][paymentguide].

            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra

            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.

            for calculating the value of

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,

            enclosed in brackets,

            to refer to it.


            For example,

            you want to present the total cost

            of two items, tax included.


            The cost of each item is stored

            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.

            The tax rate is in a number tab

            labeled TaxRate.


            The formula string for this property

            would be:

            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/propertyMetadata'
        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            When **false,** if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`,
            `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

        embeddedRecipientStartURL:
          description: >-
            Specifies a sender-provided valid URL string for redirecting an
            embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient
            still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient
            would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient
            is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete
            their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the
            server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to
            launch a signing session. 


            When `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded
            signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or
            viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the
            transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will
            reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an
            embedded signing or viewing operation launched by a partner.


            It is important to understand that in a typical embedded workflow,
            the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of
            the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders will follow
            their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity. In
            this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application
            before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated.
            However, when the sending application sets
            `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes
            directly to the embedded signing or viewing process, bypassing the
            sending application and any authentication steps the sending
            application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you
            use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code,
            Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the
            identity of the recipient.


            If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the
            `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the
            redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email
            recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient
            start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are:
            `envelopeId`, `recipientId`, `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and
            `customFields`. The `customFields` property must be set for the
            recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double
            brackets. 


            *Example*: 


            `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession?
            [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

            `enforceSignerVisibility` property must be set to **true** for the
            envelope to use this.


            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can
            only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document.
            Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or
            Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or
            Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope,
            unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an
            envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible
            to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this
            setting when an envelope is sent.

            - `carbonCopy`: Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope
            but don't need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of
            the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing
            order.

            - `certifiedDelivery`: Certified delivery recipients must receive
            the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. They don't
            need to sign, initial, date, or add information to any of the
            documents.

            - `editor`: Editors have the same management and access rights for
            the envelope as the sender. Editors can add name and email
            information, add or change the routing order, set authentication
            options, and can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the
            remaining recipients.

            - `inPersonSigner`: In-person recipients are DocuSign users who act
            as signing hosts in the same physical location as the signer.

            - `intermediaries`: Intermediary recipients can optionally add name
            and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level
            in the routing order.

            - `seal`: Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities.

            - `signer`: Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or
            add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.

            - `witness`: Witnesses are recipients whose signatures affirm that
            the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.

            Valid values:


            - `autoresponded`: The recipient's email system auto-responded to
            the email from DocuSign. This status is used in the web console to
            inform senders about the bounced-back email. This recipient status
            is only used if **Send-on-behalf-of** is turned off for the account.

            - `completed`: The recipient has completed their actions (signing or
            other required actions if not a signer) for an envelope.

            - `created`: The recipient is in a draft state. This value is only
            associated with draft envelopes (envelopes that have a status of
            `created`).

            - `declined`: The recipient declined to sign the documents in the
            envelope.

            - `delivered`: The recipient has viewed the documents in an envelope
            through the DocuSign signing website. This is not an email delivery
            of the documents in an envelope.

            - `faxPending`: The recipient has finished signing and the system is
            waiting for a fax attachment from the recipient before completing
            their signing step.

            - `sent`: The recipient has been sent an email notification that it
            is their turn to sign an envelope.

            - `signed`: The recipient has completed (signed) all required tags
            in an envelope. This is a temporary state during processing, after
            which the recipient's status automatically switches to `completed`.

          description: >
            When **true,** the text string in the document may have extra
            whitespace and still match the anchor string. This occurs in two
            cases.


            First, it matches if the document string has a single extra
            whitespace character following a non-whitespace character in the
            anchor string. For example, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then
            `Docu Sign` will match. However,
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will not match.


            Second, it matches if the document string has one or more extra
            whitespace characters following a whitespace character in the anchor
            string. For example, if the anchor string is `Docu Sign`, then
            <code>Docu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign</code> will match.


            The default value is **true.**
          type: string
        anchorAllowWhiteSpaceInCharactersMetadata:

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.

            An Approve tab enables

            recipient is considered to have signed the document. No

            information is shown on the document of the approval, but it

            is recorded as a signature in the envelope history.

            An array of strings that lists envelope-related events to track

            - `sent`: An envelope has the status `sent` in the following
            scenarios:
               - When the envelope has been sent to recipients.
               - When using remote signing, this event is triggered when the email notification with a link to the documents is sent to at least one recipient.
               - When using embedded signing, this event is triggered when the link is ready for the recipient to sign the envelope.

               An envelope remains in this state until all recipients have viewed or taken action on the envelope.

            - `delivered`: This status is triggered when all recipients have
            opened the envelope, selected the **Continue** button in the
            interface, and viewed the documents.

            - `completed`: This status is triggered when all recipients have
            completed their assigned actions on an envelope.

            - `declined`: This status is triggered when a recipient has declined
            to sign the envelope.

            - `voided`: The voided status indicates that the sender has voided
            the envelope.


            **Note:** In previous versions of the API, this value was a single
            comma-separated string.

        recipientEvents:
          description: >
            An array of strings that lists of recipient-related events that
            trigger a notification

            to your webhook Connect listener. The possible event values are:


            - `sent`: If a recipient type is set to receive an email
            notification to take action on an envelope, the recipient status is
            set to `sent` upon delivery of the email.

            - `delivered`: The recipient has viewed the documents in the
            envelope. This recipient status does not indicate email delivery of
            the documents in the envelope.

            - `completed`: The recipient has completed their assigned actions on
            an envelope.

            - `declined`: The recipient has declined to sign a document in the
            envelope.

            - `authenticationfailed`: At least one signer has failed the
            authentication check on the document. If this occurs, you have two
            options:
               - Send a reminder to the recipients, which provides the signer with another chance to access and pass the authentication.
               - Correct the document and modify the authentication setting.
            - `autoresponded`: The recipient's email system sent back an
            automatic response. This status is only used when
            **Send-on-behalf-of** is turned off for the account.


            **Note:** In previous versions of the API, this value was a single
            comma-separated string.

            When **true,** event delivery acknowledgements are enabled for your
            Connect configuration.


            DocuSign Connect awaits a valid 200 response from your application
            acknowledging that it received a message. If you do not acknowledge
            receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign
            treats the message as a failure and places it into a failure queue.
            It is imperative that you acknowledge successful receipt of Connect
            events as they occur by sending a 200 event back.


            #### When **true** and Send Individual Messages (SIM) mode is
            activated


            If the HTTP status response to a notification message is not in the
            range of 200-299,

            then the message delivery failed, and the configuration is marked as
            down.


            The message will be queued and retried once per day.

            While a Connect configuration is marked down, subsequent
            notifications will not be tried. Instead they will be immediately
            queued with the reason `Pending`.

            When a message succeeds, all queued messages for the configuration
            will be tried immediately, in order.


            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use
            **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the
            notification.


            #### When **true** and SIM mode is not activated


            If the HTTP Status response to a notification message is not in the
            range of 200-299,  then the message delivery failed, and the message
            is queued.


            The message will be retried after at least a day the next time a
            subsequent message is successfully sent to this configuration
            (subscription).  Subsequent notifications will be tried when they
            occur.

            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use
            **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the
            notification.


            #### When **false**


            When `requiresAcknowledgement` is set to **false** and you do not
            acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100
            seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and determines
            that the server is unavailable. It does not retry to send the
            notification message, and you must handle the failure manually.

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          description: >-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed.
            When **true,** the text string in a document must match the case of
            the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The
            default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the anchor string is
            `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`,
            `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When **false,** `DocuSign`,
            `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.


            This functionality uses the following rules:


            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this
            functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching
            process.


            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are
            treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true.**

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from
            their unaccented counterparts.


            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear
            right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is
            placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor
            words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in
            relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :


            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the
            first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default
            value.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the
            matching anchor word.


            **Note:** You can only specify the value of this property in POST
            requests.

            tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false.**


            For example, when set to **true,** if the input is `man` then `man`
            will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not.

            recommends that you use this signing method only when another form
            of authentication is in use.

        the documents by recipient. This functionality is enabled for envelopes
        and templates. It is not available for PowerForms.


        **Note:** Before you use Document Visibility, you should be aware of the
        following information:


        - Document Visibility must be enabled for your account by your DocuSign
        administrator. 

        - A document cannot be hidden from a recipient if the recipient has tabs
        assigned to them on the document. 

        - When the Document Visibility setting hides a document from a
        recipient, the document also does not appear in the recipient's list of
        envelopes, documents, or page images.

        - Carbon Copy, Certified Delivery (Needs to Sign), Editor, and Agent
        recipients can always see all of the documents associated with the

  - summary: This section shows you how to create and send envelopes.
    description: >
      The eSignature API Envelope category includes the resources and methods
      for sending and managing envelopes and envelope data.


      Envelopes are the key objects in the DocuSign platform. As a result, they
      are complex data structures with few required fields. See the [How-to
      guides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) for examples and solutions.


      To learn more about envelopes, see
      [Envelopes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).
    name: Envelopes
  - summary: >-
      DocuSign Connect is the DocuSign platform notification service. The
      service uses webhooks to proactively notify your application when an event
      occurs that your application wants to know about. DocuSign recommends that
      all applications use Connect instead of polling the DocuSign Signature
      Service. This section provides information about Connect configuration and
      logging. 


      **Note:** To make API calls to any of the Connect endpoints, you must be
      an account administrator.


      For more information about Connect, see [DocuSign
      Connect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) and [Custom Connect
      Configuration](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=pik1583277475390&topicId=khw1583277390582.html).
    description: >
      The Connect service enables your application to be called via

      HTTPS when an event of interest occurs.


      Use the Connect service to "end the polling madness." With

      Connect, there is no need for your application to poll DocuSign

      every 15 minutes to learn the latest about your envelopes.


      Instead, you register your interest in one or more types of

      envelope or recipient events. Then, when an interesting event

      occurs, the DocuSign platform will contact your application with

      the event's details and data. You can register interest in

      envelopes sent by particular users in your account, or for

      envelopes sent by any user.


      Connect can empower your organization to manage document actions

      as they occur, and allows you to track their changes within your

      own systems. Upon completion, envelope information, including

      document content, can be stored in your own databases or CMS

      systems, and these events can be triggered via webhooks

      delivering messages to your application.


      **Note:** To make API calls to any of the Connect endpoints, you must be
      an account administrator.


      ## Incoming Connect Calls


      To use the Connect service, your application needs to provide an

      HTTPS URL that can be called from the public Internet. If your

      application runs on a server behind your organization's firewall,

      then you will need to create a "pinhole" in the firewall to allow

      the incoming Connect calls from DocuSign to reach your

      application. You can also use other techniques such as proxy

      servers and DMZ networking for receiving the incoming calls.


      Connect delivers events over HTTP requests in JSON or XML.

      See [DocuSign Connect overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).


      If your application is not configured to accept post messages,

      DocuSign will NOT return an additional post error response to

      your listener application. If you've enabled logging on your

      configuration, it will be logged in Admin under the configuration

      failure log.


      ## Per-envelope Connect Configuration


      Instead of registering a general Connect configuration and

      listener, an individual envelope can have its own Connect

      configuration. See the

      [`eventNotification`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)

      property for envelopes.


      ## Historical Publish Endpoint


      To submit existing envelopes to an endpoint, use the
      [EnvelopePublish](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) resource.

  - summary: Send a signing request to a group of potential signers.
    description: >-
      Use the Signing Group category to manage signing groups that allow anyone
      in the group to sign a document. When you send an envelope to a signing
      group, anyone in the group can open it and sign it with their own
      signature.


      This category shows account administrators how to create a signing group
      and manage the users in the group.


      **Note:** To create and manage signing groups, you must be an account
      administrator.


      For more information about this topic, see [Signing
      Groups](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?bundleId=gav1643676262430&topicId=zgn1578456447934.html).

  - summary: A DocuSign workspace is a collaboration area for sharing files and data.
    description: >-
      A workspace is a collaborative space for sharing documents and managing
      workflows. A workspace has a single owner who must be a DocuSign user. The
      owner can invite others to the workspace as collaborators. Individuals who
      are not DocuSign users must create a DocuSign account to join a workspace
      as a collaborator.
       
      You can create an envelope directly from a workspace.


      Workspaces store the following information:


      - **Files:** Files uploaded to a workspace for storage or reuse.

      - **Documents:** A document is a component of a transaction, template, or
      workspace. When a file is added to a transaction, template, or workspace,
      it is copied as a document. Each document in a workspace has a single
      owner.

      - **Templates:** A set of documents that you can use to create a
      transaction or a workspace.

      - **Transactions:** A transaction is a series of workflow events related
      to one or more documents. These events route the documents to one or more
      individuals for the purposes of doing business. Each transaction has a
      single owner (the sender).


      **Note:** Documents in a template are not individually listed as files.
