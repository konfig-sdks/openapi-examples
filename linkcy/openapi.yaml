        This second step allow LinkCy to verify that the phone number and
        country code provided by the consumer is valid and he controls the SIM.


        If the consumer does not provide a valid code, he will not get access to
        the KYC step which is also mandatory.


        The SMS code is a 6-digits and valid for 10 minutes and the consumer has
        5 attempts. Once the delay of the number of attempts is reached, you
        have to ask for another code by using: Send consumer verification code
        Endpoint here. 


        Note: You can simulate that step in a Sandbox environment. Code is
        always 123456.

      summary: Verify the address of an end-user
      operationId: Kyc_verifyAddress
      description: >-
        This endpoint allows you to verify an end-user's address using different
        methods:

         - LINK: This method generates a URL link that the end-user can use to complete its Proof of Address (POA).

         - UPLOADED_DOCUMENT: Use this method when a POA document has already been [uploaded](https://docs.sandbox.linkcy.io/) which will be used to verify the address.

         - DELEGATED: When the address verification is delegated to the partner (property "delegatedPoa" set to "true") and the POA document has been [uploaded](https://docs.sandbox.linkcy.io/), you can use this method to update the address status to "VERIFIED".

        Physical users need to complete a due diligence (KYC), this step is
        mandatory to be able to use banking features. Due diligence is performed
        with the local language of your users.


        Once the field "phoneValidated" is in "true" state, you will be able to
        request a KYC for you consumer by link or by SDK.


        BY LINK: 


        The link is valid for 720H. Do not ask for multiple links, this can
        delay the onboarding of the consumer and trigger security thresholds on
        our side.


        By default, for performance reasons related to pictures, we oblige the
        consumer to do the KYC on a mobile phone, if you want to allow them to
        use the computer, please ask your consumer care.


        For a fully embedded experience, we suggest you provide us with a
        success and a failure URL.


        BY SDK:


        We will provide you a SDK token valid for 24H that will allow one your
        user to perform its KYC via SDK. Do not hesitate to contact us for more
        information.


        Note: We do not allow consumers to download pictures from the gallery.

        This endpoint allows you to ask a KYB verification for a Corporate
        End-User.


        In order to use this endpoint, all its UBOs and directors must have been
        [declared](https://docs.sandbox.linkcy.io/) and have completed a
        validated [KYC application](https://docs.sandbox.linkcy.io/).


        After using this endpoint, a Linkcy compliance officer will verify the
        information provided and update the KYB status to one of the following
        values:

         - VALIDATED -> this corporate is now authorized to access Linkcy's banking features.

         - NEED_ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION -> Additional information is needed to validate this corporate. The description of the requested information will be displayed in the kybStatusReason field.

         - DECLINED -> this corporate violates compliance rules and is not authorized to use Linkcy's banking features.

        This is the first step to create an Individual consumer. Phone object is
        mandatory to be able to go on to the next steps. You can add optional
        fields, this will help us to manage compliance triggers.


        Only a few pieces of information are asked here, most of it will be
        extracted from documents during the KYC process. By doing the Endpoint:
        Get Consumer information, you will get access to all data.


        You cannot create two consumers with the same phone number. Phone
        numbers must be unique.

        Please note: when creating the first card of a ledger, if the specified
        ledger is not empty, we will have to empty it briefly in order to
        configure the card.The money will be back in the ledger within a few
        seconds.

        Beneficiaries are the one who will receive funds. When you add a
        beneficiary, the consumer must use the exact full name. If he adds as a
        beneficiary one of his own accounts, we must be able to detect it. It
        will simplify Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) during a transfer.


        You must fill one of the beneficiary types. BIC / SWIFT code is only
        required for IBAN. If you want to simplify transfers later, we suggest
        you add a SWIFT code for US and UK beneficiaries.


        This operation might require **SCA**.

            - `PUSH_NOTIFICATION`: will send a notification if the SCA is
            required.

            - `JOIN_CODE`: will return a join code if SCA is required.

        information patched, you will have to perform another action:

         - External ID -> no action to perform

         - Phone -> you will need to use Endpoint POST Send consumer verification code & validate consumer phone

         - Address : we will use our tools to check if the address is valid or not, we recommend you to ask your consumer to confirm the address once the modification is done. Address is very important to send cards. Once the card is activated, the address status will go from valid to verified.

         - Email address -> The "emailAddressVerified" status will switch to "false" you will need to use Endpoint POST Send a verification email to the consumer to verify the email address. 

         - Source of funds -> no action to perform

         - Occupation -> no action to perform

         - Terms & Condition -> Needed if "termsAccepted" is "false".

        To do this, you can download the last of version of the TCs directly
        from our APIs! By default, the language is English, but if you need a
        specific language, feel free to ask your customer care!


        Once TCs are updated, the field "termsAccepted" will change into the
        "false" state and you will need to use this Endpoint to get the last
        version. Then, you will have to PATCH your end-users
        ([CONSUMER](https://docs.sandbox.linkcy.io/)/[CORPORATE](https://docs.sandbox.linkcy.io/))
        each time they sign the last versions.
