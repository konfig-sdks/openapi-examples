    # Introduction


    Belvo is an open banking API for Latin America that allows companies to
    access banking and fiscal information in a secure as well as agile way.


    Through our API, you can access:



    - **Bank information** such as account information, real-time

    balance, historical transactions, and account owner identification.


    - **Fiscal information** such as received and sent invoices and tax returns.

    In this API reference you'll find all the information you need about each


    endpoint and resource.

    ## Environment


    We currently offer three environments: sandbox, development, and

    production.



    When using our SDKs, make sure to use the **Alias** (and not the Base URL).



    | Environment | Purpose | Access |

    |-----------|-------|-------|

    | **Sandbox** | The [Sandbox
    environment](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/test-in-sandbox) is dedicated
    for your testing and development phases. In this environment, you can create
    links without real credentials and you can pull test data from all
    endpoints. **⚠️The sandbox environment is refreshed frequently and your test
    data can be updated or deleted.** | Base URL (cURL):
    https://sandbox.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias (SDKs): sandbox|

    |**Development**|The Development environment is dedicated for testing with
    real credentials and institutions with real-world institutions. You can
    create up to 25 links for free in this environment.| Base URL (cURL):
    https://development.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias (SDKs): development |

    | **Production** | The Production environment is dedicated for live
    applications with real connections to institutions. In this environment, you

    will need real credentials to create links and you will pull real data from
    the institutions.| Base URL (cURL): https://api.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias

    (SDKs): production|



    For each environment, you'll need to [generate separate API

    keys](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/get-your-belvo-api-keys).



    ## Response codes



    We use the following HTTP status code in the response depending on the

    success or failure:



    | Status Code | Description |

    |-----------|-------|

    | `200` | ✅ **Success** - The content is available in the response body. |

    | `201` | ✅ **Success** - The content was created successfully on Belvo. |

    | `204` | ✅ **Success** - No content to return. |

    | `400` | ❌ **Bad Request Error** - Request returned an error, detail in
    content.|

    | `401` | ❌ **Unauthorized** - The Belvo credentials provided are not
    valid.|

    | `404` | ❌ **Not Found** - The resource you try to access cannot be found.|

    | `405` | ❌ **Method Not Allowed** - The HTTP method you are using is not
    accepted for this resource.|

    | `408` | ❌ **Request Timeout** - The request timed out and was terminated
    by the server.|

    | `428` | ❌ **MFA Token Required** - MFA token was required by the
    institution to connect. |

    | `500` | ❌ **Internal Server Error** - The detail of the error is available
    in the response body.|



    ## Error handling



    ### Error messages



    Belvo API errors are returned in JSON format. For example, an error might

    look like this:



    ```json


    [
        {
          "request_id": "a6e1c493d7a29d91aed4338e6fcf077d",
          "message": "This field is required.",
          "code": "required",
          "field": "link"
        }
    ]


    ```



    Typically, an error response will have the following parameters:


    - `request_id`: a unique ID for the request, you should share it with the

    Belvo support team for investigations.


    - `message`: human-readable description of the error.


    - `code`: a unique code for the error. Check the table below to see how to

    handle each error code.


    - `field` *(optional)*: The specific field in the request body that has an

    issue.




    ### Request identifier


    When you need help with a specific error, add the request identifier

    (`request_id`) in your message to the Belvo support team. This will speed up

    investigations and get you back up and running in no time at all.



    ### Error codes and troubleshooting



    For a full list of errors and how to troubleshoot them, please see our

    dedicated [Error handling

    articles](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/integration-overview#error-handling)

    in our DevPortal.

      A **Link** is a set of credentials associated to an end-user's access to
      an **institution**.


      <div style="background-color:#f4f6f8; border-left: 6px solid
      #808080;padding: 12px;margin-left: 25px; border-radius: 4px; margin-right:
      25px">

      <strong>Example: </strong> The username and password combination used to
      log in to an online banking application would be a link.

      </div>


      You will need to register a **Link** before accessing information from
      that specific end-user, such as account or transaction details.


      <div style="background-color:#f4f6f8; border-left: 6px solid
      #4CAF50;padding: 12px;margin-left: 25px; border-radius: 4px; margin-right:
      25px">

      <strong>Note: </strong> We recommend using our <a
      href="https://developers.belvo.com/docs/connect-widget"
      target="_blank">Connect Widget</a> to handle link creation and link status
      updates.

      </div>


      You have the possibility to register two types of links:


      ### Recurrent links (default)


      With recurrent links, Belvo automatically refreshes information weekly and
      notifies you via [Webhooks](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/webhooks) so
      you always have up-to-date data. Then, when you receive the webhook, you
      can make GET requests to the List or Detail endpoints to instantly access
      up-to-date information, without needing to connect to the institution.


      <img src="https://files.readme.io/7b6c0d4-Recurrent_Link_FLow.png"
      alt="fiscal-endpoints" width="950">


      You can also make POST calls directly to the institution, as with single
      links, as soon as the link is created. However, we recommend you follow
      the flow described above (waiting for the webhook event) for a more
      optimal experience.


      ### Single links


      Single links are used to perform ad hoc data access to accounts, owners,
      transactions, and so on. For example, you can use it when you want to do
      an underwriting process to assess risk before lending money.


      For single links, you have to perform POST calls to an institution **every
      time** you want to access fresh data.

  - description: >-
      An **account** is the representation of a bank account inside a financial
      institution. A user can have one or more accounts in an institution. 


      For example, one user (or link) can have a checking account, several
      credit cards, and a loan account.


      Querying for a user's account information is useful as you can get
      information regarding:


      - what types of accounts the user has.

      - the balance for each account (savings, checking, credit card, loan, and
      so on).

      - detailed information regarding their credit card spending.

      - the current situation of any loans they may have.
    name: Accounts
  - description: >-
      A **transaction** contains the detailed information of each movement
      inside an account. For example, a purchase at a store or a restaurant.
    name: Transactions
  - description: >-
      A **balance** represents the amount of funds available in a checking or
      savings account over a period of time.

      > 📘 

      > 

      > Savings accounts that do not have any associated transactions (for
      example, some _poupança_ accounts in Brazil) will not contain accurate
      Balance information. We do not recommend using the Balance endpoint for
      these types of accounts. 

      > 

      > Savings accounts vary from institution to institution, so we recommend
      that you first use our [Retrieve transactions for a
      link](https://developers.belvo.com/reference/retrievetransactions)
      request, adding the `account` in the request body, to see if the Savings
      account has any associated transactions.
    name: Balances
  - description: >-
      An **owner** represents the person who has access to a Link and is the
      owner of all the accounts inside the Link.


      You can use this endpoint in order to get useful information about your
      client, such as:


      - their full name

      - key contact information

      - information about the ID document they used when opening the account

      Use the Incomes endpoint to gather insights on an account's income sources
      for the past 365 days. The endpoint is particularly useful when you want
      to verify a person's income.

      Belvo's Recurring Expenses API allows you to identify a user's regular
      payments for subscription services, such as Netflix or gym memberships, as
      well as utility payments, such as electricity or phone bills. We return
      information for up to 365 days.

      Belvo's Risk Insights endpoint exposes a set of features that can be used
      to improve your company's credit risk and opportunity decisions.


      This set of features can be used as building blocks to create or iterate
      on your credit score using transactional banking data to improve the
      predictive power of your models. You can use these components as you
      require and make the most sense for your specific use case. 


      We take up to 365 days of transactional data from the user's checking,
      savings, loans, and credit card accounts to calculate the risk insights.
      We perform calculations on this set of transactions and provide aggregate
      metrics in the following periods: three days, one week, one month, three
      months, six months, and twelve months.


      > **Note**: Categorized transaction metrics period

      > 

      > At present, for our categorized transaction metrics (`category_metrics`)
      we only supply the calculated totals for the last three months. 



      If you need to know the currency of the account, make a GET Details
      request to the Accounts endpoint (using the account ID you receive from in
      the accounts array of the response).

      An **invoice** is the representation of an electronic invoice, that can be
      received or sent, by a business or an individual and has been uploaded to
      the fiscal institution's website. Multiple INFLOW (invoice received) and
      OUTFLOW (invoice sent) invoices can be retrieved inside each link coming
      from a fiscal institution.

      Our Tax declarations endpoint lets you retrieve the electronic
      representation of the tax declaration document emitted by a country's tax
      authority.

      A **tax return** is the representation of the tax return document sent
      every year by a person or a business to the tax authority in the country.

      related to a person or a business (you will find examples for both in the
      endpoints below).
    name: Tax returns
  - description: >-
      Our **Tax status** endpoint lets you retrieve information about a person's
      or business's tax situation, according to the country's tax authority. 


      - For SAT (Mexico), this information is extracted from the _Constancia de
      situación fiscal_ document.

      - For DIAN (Colombia), this information is extracted from the _Registro
      Único Tributario_ document.

      A **tax retention** is the amount of money that the payer must deduct from
      the total amount of a purchase invoice, according to the fiscal
      institution’s regulations.


      With Belvo’s Tax Retentions resource, you can quickly and easily consult
      information regarding a user’s tax retentions over a given period or for a
      specific invoice. This is particularly useful when you want to aid your
      user in their tax returns as for each invoice you receive the:


      - invoice amount

      - amount that is exempt from taxation

      - total amount that is taxed

      - breakdown of all the taxes applied to the invoice

      # Credit score


      Belvo's Credit Score (powered by FICO) resource allows you to receive an
      industry-standard credit score based on a link's transactional and account
      data.


      > **Note**: At present, the credit score resource is **only** available
      for OFDA Brazil links.


      For any OFDA Brazil link, you can simply send through the `link` ID (with
      an optional `date_to` parameter), and Belvo will respond with the
      calculated credit score (provided there is at least 30 days of
      transactional data available for the link).


      Request Example

      ```json


      {
        "link": "2ccd5e15-194a-4a19-a45a-e7223c7e6717", // ID of the OFDA link.
        "date_to": "2023-02-28", // Optional date until when you want the credit score to be calculated.
        "save_data": true
      }


      ```


      Response Example

      ```json

      {
        "id": "03a7b0d1-efc7-4ab8-981e-89e0c82db03ea",

        "date_to": "2023-01-01", // Date until when transactional and account data were taken into account for the calculation
        "score": 400, // The resulting credit score.
        "reason_codes": [
          // Array of reasons for the credit score.

        To delete links in bulk, we recommend looping through the list of links
        you want to delete and making the delete request.

          > 🚧 **Rate limiting and IP blocking**
          > 
          > An important technical note for performing operations in batches is to take into consideration our rate-limiting: up to 80 requests every 30 seconds. If you exceed this limit, you run the risk of Belvo blocking your IP from making further requests.
          > 
          > For more information, or if your IP address has been blocked, please contact our [support team](https://support.belvo.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

              When you make a asynchronous request, Belvo responds with a `202 -
              Accepted` payload, including the `request_id`. Once we have
              retrieved the transaction information, you will receive a
              `new_transactions_available` webhook with the link and request
              IDs.



              **Note**: This parameter is case sensitive (in other words, if you
              write `ASYNC`, then Belvo will default to a synchronous call).

              Recommended header parameter to make your POST request to retrieve
              invoices asynchronous (thus preventing timeouts).


              When you make a asynchronous request, Belvo responds with a `202 -
              Accepted` payload, including the `request_id`. Once we have
              retrieved the invoice information, you will receive a
              `new_invoices_available` webhook with the link and request IDs.



              **Note**: This parameter is case sensitive (in other words, if you
              write `ASYNC`, then Belvo will default to a synchronous call).

        Retrieve a credit score for a specific link.


        Before requesting a credit score for a link, you must also make the
        following requests in order for the score to be accurately calculated.


        - <a href="https://developers.belvo.com/reference/retrieveaccounts"
        target="_blank">POST Retrieve Accounts for a Link</a>

        - <a href="https://developers.belvo.com/reference/retrievetransactions"
        target="_blank">POST Retrieve Transactions for a Link</a> (minimum 30
        days of data, maximum 365 days of data)




        This is because the credit score is calculated based on the
        transactional data retrieved from the link.


        We use up to 12 months of transactional data.


        The minimum is 30 days of checking account transactional data.


        The `date_to` parameter is optional and can be used to specify the date
        until which you want to retrieve the credit score. If not provided, the
        most recent credit score will be retrieved.

            with.



            Each transaction you provide in the `transactions` array must have
            an associated account. If you provide transactions without an
            associated account, we return an error.


            **Note:** Each object corresponds to one unique account.
