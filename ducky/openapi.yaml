  title: Ducky Data V3 - climate data APIs
  description: >
    Ducky Data's APIs provide footprint data for a wide variety of products and
    circular services, as well as individuals, and consumption-based emissions
    for municipalities and other administrative units.


    The endpoints are divided by functionality. 

    The Calculate endpoints compute the footprint of an individual based on
    their habits and other lifestyle data. 

    The Change endpoint generates climate friendly tips based on the user's
    habits, and can be used to nudge the user towards sutainable behavioral
    change.

    The Compare endpoints return the average footprint of a citizen in a given
    area (municipality or BSU).

    The Convert endpoints turn physical data like energy use or transaction
    amount into climate footprint.

    Reporting endpoints are for calculating scope 1 & 2 emissions according to
    the GHG protocol.

    The Track endpoints returns the values of indicators (drivers of footprint)
    for a given area (municipality or BSU).

    The Translate endpoints contextualize a given quantity of CO2e by expressing
    them in something more tangible, like a flight trip.


    In the description of each endpoint, you will find the link to a user
    documentation page detailing the sources and calculation principles.

    All of our user documentation pages can be found
    [here](https://support.ducky.eco/en/ducky-insights#introduction-to-ducky-insights).


    ### Base URL

    The API is served over HTTPS.

    The section [API Servers](https://storage.googleapis.com) indicates the base
    URLs for all requests in the documentation.


    ### Authentication

    The API requires [authentication](https://storage.googleapis.com). You have
    to negotiate an `access_token` and send it with every request, in the
    `authorization` header.


    Step-by-step:

    1. [Email Ducky to request](mailto:api@ducky.eco) a `CLIENT_ID` and a
    `CLIENT_SECRET`

    2. Negotiate an `access_token` with Auth0

    3. Send authenticated requests to Ducky API


    Learn in detail how to negotiate and use an `access_token` in the
    [Authentication section](https://storage.googleapis.com).

        Get footprint in kilograms CO2 equivalent for a given amount of money
        spent in a category.

        This endpoint receives a list of monetary transactions and returns, for
        each transaction, a footprint.

        Habit data can additionally be provided to improve the calculation.

        If no habit data is provided a default average dataset for the given
        datasource will be used. 

        The returned value is given in kilograms and is rounded to grams.

        Get an individual or household footprint in kilograms CO2 equivalent for

        This endpoint receives a list of habits broken down into categories and
        a household description. 

        This can be used to build your own climate calculator with as many
        inputs as you'd like.

        If an empty body is provided an average footprint for the given
        datasource will be returned.

        This can be used to compare a person's climate footprint to the average
        footprint for a country.

        All inputs are optional and missing values are defaulted.

        The returned object contains a breakdown of an annual footprint in
        categories and subcategories, with absolute and percentage values.

        Both municipalities and basic statistical units (BSUs) are valid areas.

        The footprints are calculated based on the area indicators accessible
        through the track/transport endpoint. 

        If an indicator is missing for an area, the most granular indicator
        available will be used instead. 

        It will be collected from the closest parent which contains the relevant
        indicator. 

        In the case of a BSU, this would mean that the indicator from a

        also the carbon savings possible as a result of renting, repairing or
        buying the item used.


        Note that this endpoint converts items that can be linked to [GPC brick
        codes](https://gpc-browser.gs1.org/). Services, which cannot be linked
        to GPC brick codes, are covered by the [Convert Finance
        endpoint](https://doc.api.ducky.eco/api-reference/api-v3#post-/convert/finance),
        where their footprint is specified by their price.


        This endpoint receives:

        * Unique item identifier: GPC code or item name


        Optional input fields:

        * Purchase type (called useMode):
            * None (only returns the average cradle-to-gate footprint of the given item)
            * Buying used
            * Renting
            * Repairing
        * Number of items

        * Duration of the rental period

        * Price of the item

        * Business model of the company: Online or Physical

        * Weight of the item


        The endpoint returns the cradle-to-gate footprint of producing a new
        item(s) of the type specified, and optionally the savings associated
        with the purchase type.

        For example, if the item you input is a t-shirt, and the purchase mode
        is buying used, you are returned the footprint of producing a t-shirt
        and the achievable savings from buying it used.

        There are many relevant reporting schemes and Ducky has chosen to comply
        with the leading GHG Protocol standard.

        Here, an organisation’s GHG emissions are classified into three scopes:
          - Scope 1 (direct emissions)
          - Scope 2 (indirect emissions)
          - Scope 3 (value chain emissions)
        Our reporting endpoints are created to ensure compliance with the GHG
        Protocol.


        Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from company-owned and controlled
        resources.

        They are divided into four categories: stationary combustion (e.g fuels,
        heating sources), mobile combustion (vehicles owned or operated by the
        firm), fugitive emissions (GHG gases released from refrigeration, air
        conditioning units) and process emissions (released during industrial
        processes, on-site manufacturing).

        Note that fugitive emissions are not included in our calculations as it
        is not common to account for them.


        To summarise, the emissions from all the fuels used by the organisation
        are reported under Scope 1.

          Each entry refers to a company-owned asset that releases CO2e
          emissions.

          Each entry contains activity data which can be expressed in one of the
          three available types:

          1. Fuel used

          2. Distance travelled

          3. Money spent on fuel


          It is mandatory to provide at least one type of activity data.

          It is unnecessary to fill more than one type of activity data.

          If you choose to provide more than one type of activity data, there
          exists a preference hierarchy for deciding which activity data will be
          used in the calculations: fuel use takes precedence over distance
          travelled, and distance travelled takes precedence over money spent on
          fuel.

        There are many relevant reporting schemes and Ducky has chosen to comply
        with the leading GHG Protocol standard.

        Here, an organisation’s GHG emissions are classified into three scopes:
          - Scope 1 (direct emissions)

          - Scope 3 (value chain emissions)
        Our reporting endpoints are created to ensure compliance with the GHG
        Protocol.


        Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of
        purchased electricity, heating, cooling and steam, from a utility
        provider.

        In other words, all GHG emissions released from the consumption of
        purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling.

        The GHG standard highlights two approaches to allocate Scope 2 GHG
        emissions to the end consumer: location-based and market-based.

        The market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that
        companies have purposefully chosen (or their lack of choice), while the
        location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids
        on which energy consumption occurs.

                  This field is relevant when an area is missing an indicator,
                  but one if its parents has it.

                  The endpoint returns the indicator from the parent, and
                  `originAreaId` will be the `areaId` of the parent.

                  When `timeRange` is `yearly`, this parameter will not be
                  outputted.

            groups and cannot be used as inputs.

            * Level 2 categories are well-detailed food groups and are the most
            basic level at which we can calculate CO2 footprint for food and
            drink.

            * Level 3 categories are specific food items.  These are only
            available in the Norwegian dataset.


            Multipliers are marked with whether they are available in the
            Norwegian (NO), Japanese (JA) and/or British (UK) datasets. Note in
            particular

            that meat (level 2) is only present in JA and UK, but is split into
            beef, pork etc in the NO dataset (level 2).

            You will find the transport categories below. The different levels
            reflect the degree of precision.

            * Level 1 categories are averages of different modes of propulsion
            and travel patterns. Use them if you don't know which mode of
            propulsion is used.

            * Level 2 categories are well-detailed and cover most of the mode of
            transportation.

            * Level 3 categories prove higher granularity and greater accuracy.
            Use them if you have detailed knowledge of the mode of propulsion.


            We differentiate between for instance long and short flights because
            of differences in the type of aircraft used, occupancy and emission
            profiles for different parts of the journey.

            MARKDOWN:\n## Visste du at?\n- 

            Kjøttproduksjon fører til store CO₂e- utslipp på grunn av
            fôrdyrkingen (som i stor grad består av soya og mais), metanutslipp
            gjennom raping fra drøvtyggere og hugging av regnskog.\n- 

            Det er store forskjeller på type kjøtt og hvordan kjøttet er
            fremstilt. 

            Eksempelvis vil det være mye bedre for klimagassutslippene om du
            spiser viltkjøtt enn kjøtt fra storindustri, og kylling fremfor
            storfe og sau.\n- 

            Ved å teste ut plantebaserte retter i kostholdet ditt bidrar du til
            en viktig reduksjon i klimagassutslipp.\n\n## 

            Dokumenterte effekter\n- 

            Beregningen er gjort ved å fjerne ditt kaloriinntaket fra
            kjøttprodukter, og overføre disse kaloriene til grønnsaker, frukt og
            kornprodukter.\n- Vi har lagt til grunn at 20% av kaloriintaket
            kommer fra frokost. \n\n##

      description: >
        Protected requests expect the `Authorization` header with a bearer token
        respecting the format `Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`.


        This **documentation is interactive**: set your `access_token` here and
        test all requests directly from your browser

        (`access_token` must be formatted as `Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`).

        Or set it individually for each request, in the `Authorization` header.



        ### Introduction

        The API requires an `access_token` for every request (except
        [/ping](https://storage.googleapis.com)).


        Step-by-step:

        1. [Ask Ducky](mailto:api@ducky.eco) for a `CLIENT_ID` and a
        `CLIENT_SECRET`

        2. Negotiate an `access_token` with Auth0

        3. Send authenticated requests to Ducky API


        Keep reading to learn how to obtain an `access_token` and use it to
        perform requests.


        ---


        ### Prerequisite

        To use the API, you have to get `CLIENT_ID` and a `CLIENT_SECRET`.

        To do so, please contact Ducky at [api@ducky.eco](mailto:api@ducky.eco).


        > Note: even without an `access_token`, you can browse the documentation
        and explore its possibilities by looking at the example outputs.



        ### Getting an access token

        #### Request

        Authentication is provided by Auth0. Before using Ducky API, you send a
        query to Auth0, asking for an `access_token`.


        To negotiate an `access_token`, send a request based on this curl
        snippet (update it with your `$CLIENT_ID`& `$CLIENT_SECRET`):


        ```shell

        curl --request POST \
          --url https://ducky-prod.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token \
          --header 'content-type: application/json' \
          --data '{"client_id":"$CLIENT_ID","client_secret":"$CLIENT_SECRET","audience":"ducky-api-prod","grant_type":"client_credentials"}'
        ```


        #### Response

        The response contains an `access_token` and an expiration time. You
        should store both and use the `access_token` until its expiration date.
        After expiration, repeat the process above to negotiate a new token.


        ```json

        {
          "access_token": "example_access_token",
          "token_type": "Bearer",
          "expires_in": 86400
        }

        ```

        ```


        ### Usage

        Now that you have an `access_token`, you can start using the Ducky API.

        Send the `access_token` with each request, in an `Authorization` header.

        Make sure to prefix it with the `token_type` which is always `Bearer`.


        ##### Example

        To make sure you're ready to use the API, you can use the
        [/ping/protected endpoint](https://storage.googleapis.com).

        It validates your `access_token` and checks if the API is ready to
        accept connections.


        ```shell

        curl --request GET \
          --url https://api.ducky.eco/v3/ping/protected \
          --header 'authorization: Bearer example_access_token'
        ```
      in: header
      name: Authorization
      type: apiKey
