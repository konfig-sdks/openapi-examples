    TripAdd API enables you to create personalized travel ancillary product
    bundles and make orders.


    ## Concepts


    A **Bundle** is a set of products defined by an ancillary manager. They can
    contain specific products or product categories. Bundles and markups are
    managed on the TripAdd [Partner Portal](https://dashboard.tripadd.com/).


    A **Bundle Offer** is a unique short-lived set of product offers created for
    a specific user and based on specific trip parameters. Bundle offers can be
    available from 15 minutes to 25 hours, depending on which products are
    included in the bundle. The offers later expire and have to be generated
    again to ensure up-to-date pricing and availability of products at the time
    of booking. The bundle expiration time is returned in the API response.


    ### Pricing Types


    TripAdd supports the following pricing types for products in bundles:
    **passenger** and **group**. The passenger-type products will have
    individual pricing per passenger, while the group-type products will have a
    single price for the entire group/booking. When calculating the total order
    price, you should multiply the passenger-type product prices by the
    passenger count and add the group-type product prices directly.


    ### Age Categories


    TripAdd uses these age categories: adult (12 years old and above), child
    (2-11 years old), and infant (up to 2 years old). Each product will specify
    which age categories it applies to.


    ### Product Delivery


    Product delivery information is returned in the create order response.
    TripAdd has a wide variety of products with different delivery options. Each
    product will contain its delivery information consisting of a short
    description, voucher codes, and/or links to vouchers or product pages. For
    example, the eSIM product delivery will have the following information:


    ```json

    {
      "description": "Your data plan will be automatically activated on {{arrivalDateTime}}. You can install the eSIM at any time before your departure."
      "links": [
        "label": "Claim Now",
        "url": "https://app.tripadd.com/esim/jwmdyxemed"
      ]
    }

    ```


    ## Integration Steps


    1. [Reach out](https://tripadd.com/) to acquire credentials to the TripAdd
    [Partner Portal](https://dashboard.tripadd.com/).


    2. Generate API tokens. On the partner portal, go to "Integration" → "API
    Tokens" and click "Create Token" to generate a new API token. Make sure to
    save the token because it cannot be retrieved in the dashboard again.


    3. Create a Bundle. Click "New Bundle" and follow the steps to set up a
    product bundle. At the "Installation" step, you will receive a unique
    "Bundle ID" which you will need for the API calls. Bundles created in "Test
    Mode" can only be used with "Test Mode" tokens.


    4. Call the "Create Bundle Offer" endpoint. Each time you want to present a
    bundle offer to the user, you should call this endpoint. It will check
    product availability and pricing based on trip parameters and create a
    unique offer.


    5. Call the "Create Order" endpoint. Once the user selects the products,
    completes the booking, and you successfully process the payment, call this
    API to purchase the products.


    ## Authentication


    TripAdd API expects your access token as part of the `Authorization` header
    in your requests using the `Bearer` method. Send your token in the HTTP
    request header like this: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The access token
    must be provided with all API calls. Access tokens created in "Test Mode"
    work only with data created in "Test Mode" and vice versa.


    **Notice:** Make sure you keep your access tokens secret and do not expose
    them to the client side code.


    ## Environments


    TripAdd API is available on two environments: **sandbox** and
    **production**. The sandbox environment is meant for integration testing:
    the API matches production but the orders will not incur charges. Access
    tokens on these environments will be different.


    | Environment | API Base URL                       |

    |-------------|------------------------------------|

    | Sandbox     | https://sandbox.tripadd.com/v1     |

    | Production  | https://api.tripadd.com/v1         |


    ## Front-end


    TripAdd bundles can be integrated into any checkout flow using your existing
    technology stack. You only need to make sure to allow HTML tags in product
    and delivery description fields.


    Optionally, if you use React in your front end, you can take advantage of
    our [**React component
    library**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tripadd/components). It is a
    collection of UI elements providing the easiest way to integrate the TripAdd
    bundles into your checkout path.


    # Changelog


    **1.8.0 (2024-01-17)** Added support for partial orders: you can now specify
    individual products for each passenger. Added `passenger_purchases` to the
    "Create Order" request. The previous request format is still supported but
    deprecated.


    **1.7.9 (2023-12-12)** Added `customer_ip` element to the `available_data`
    object in the "Create Bundle Offer" request.


    **1.7.8 (2023-10-22)** Updated `booking_reference` in CreateOrderRequest` to
    accept values from minimum 5 to maximum 16 character long.


    **1.7.7 (2023-10-16)** Added `confirmation_recipients` in the "Create Order"
    request, allowing you to specify the recipients for the order confirmation
    and order cancellation emails.


    **1.7.6 (2023-10-03)** Added `net_price` in the "Create Bundle Offer" API
    response.


    **1.7.5 (2023-08-24)** Added `delivery` to "Create Order" response, which
    contains information about product delivery to user.


    **1.7.4 (2023-08-22)** Added `terms_url` in the "Create Bundle Offer" API
    response. You can use it to link users to the Terms and Conditions for the
    products in the bundle.


    **1.7.3 (2023-08-09)** Added support for partial cancellations. It is now
    possible to cancel only part of the order by specifying product IDs.


    **1.7.2 (2023-08-04)** Added `support_url` in the "Create Order" API
    response.


    **1.7.1 (2023-06-21)** Added product cancellation details to the "Product"
    object (`cancellation_policy`, `refundable_until`).


    **1.7.0 (2023-06-21)** Added the detailed pricing information to the "Create
    Bundle Offer" response (`pricing`, `bundled_pricing`). Changed the `price`
    and `bundled_price` values to include the TripAdd fee and removed the
    separate `fee` object. The `price` field in the "Create Order" request will
    have to include the TripAdd fee, as the separate field for `fee` is removed.


    **1.6.1 (2023-05-05)** Made the customer's phone number optional in the
    "Create Order" request. To receive all the product offers that do require
    the customer's phone number, `customer_phone` has to be set as "true" in
    `available_data` in the "Create Bundle Offer" request.


    **1.6.0 (2023-05-03)** Added product delivery information to "Create Order"
    response. You can now find product instructions, coupon codes and links to
    vouchers in the response to construct your own product delivery email.


    **1.5.1 (2023-05-02)** Added `expires_at` in the BundleOffer response. It
    will inform you how long the bundle offer is available for the booking until
    it expires and has to be generated again.


    **1.5.0 (2023-04-14)** Renamed "Create Bundle" API to "Create Bundle Offer"
    API to improve distinction between bundles and bundle offers. The
    documentation reflects the new API but the old API paths and parameters are
    still being supported until migration is complete.


    **1.4.2 (2023-04-14)** Made `date_of_birth`, `gender`, `cabin_class`
    optional and removed `retail_price`.


    **1.4.1 (2023-04-13)** Made `outbound_flights` optional.


    **1.4.0 (2023-02-22)** Added `language` property on CreateBundleRequest
    object. The language property should be ISO 639-1 (language code) i.e. "en".


    **1.3.0 (2023-02-22)** Removed `price` from the bundles and added
    `bundled_price` on bundle products. You can now display how much individual
    products cost when purchased in full bundle.


    **1.2.0 (2023-01-27)** Added "Cancel Order" API.


    **1.1.1 (2022-11-28)** Added `cabin_class` on the flight object.


    **1.1.0 (2022-11-25)** Added "Get Order" API. It is now possible to fetch
    any previous order information by its ID.


    **1.0.4 (2022-11-24)** Made passenger email and phone fields optional. At
    least one (customer's) email and phone pair is still required to deliver the
    products after purchase.


    **1.0.3 (2022-11-16)** Moved passengers data to orders. The passenger data
    is now collected at the time of ordering and only the passenger age category
    is required to generate a product bundle. If possible the optional
    information should be provided for better recommendations.


    **1.0.2 (2022-11-07)** Made customer address optional. It is now possible to
    create an order without customer's address although any additional
    information will enable more products.


    **1.0.1 (2022-11-03)** Added optional fields for providing flight departure
    and arrival terminals. The additional information will enable more products.


    **1.0.0** Initial API release.

      description: >
        Creates a personalized travel ancillary product bundle offer based on
        the provided trip information. The flight and passenger information will
        be used to select the best products (according to the particular flight
        options and passenger types). The offers expire between 15 minutes and
        25 hours depending on the products in the bundle. The bundle offers can
        only be used for purchase once. You should generate a new offer for each
        checkout session. After the bundle has expired, we cannot guarantee a
        successful purchase of products due to any changes in pricing and/or
        availability.


        ### ❗️ Review available_data field


        You may not have all the customer and passenger data available at the
        time of creating the bundle offer. If any additional data (such as the
        customer's phone number or PNR) will be collected later in the process
        or become available during the ordering, you should set the appropriate
        flags to `true`. Certain products requiring additional data will not be
        returned in the bundle offer if their flags are set to `false`.
