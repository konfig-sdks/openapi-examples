    Use [/v2/auth/login](https://api.packetfabric.com) endpoint to get the
    token.



    Use that token and "Authorize" button to authenticate your requests.



    You can also use that token to authorize your `curl` request:


    ```

    curl -X GET "https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/activity-logs" -H "accept: */*"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 12a30d30-20c0-4f62-a982-eb1424631094"

    ```


    Python code to authenticate and utilize the

    [Bearer
    token](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/):


    ```

    import requests

    login_url = 'https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/auth/login'

    login_payload = {
        'login': 'admin',
        'password': 'p4ssw0rd'
    }

    r = requests.post(login_url, json=login_payload)

    auth_token = r.json()['token']

    request_header = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {auth_token}'
    }

    contacts_url = 'https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/contacts'

    r = requests.get(contacts_url, headers=request_header)

    ```


    *For resellers only*:


    To make the request on behalf of reseller's customer - add `On-Behalf:
    customer UUID` header to the request:


    ```

    curl -X GET "https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/activity-logs" -H "accept: */*"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 12a30d30-20c0-4f62-a982-eb1424631094" -H
    "On-Behalf: 11111111-2222-3333-4444-eb1424631094"

    ```


    *For API Key Authentication*

    To utilize an API Key instead of login/password, you will need to generate a
    key and save the token.

    Using that token, as the Bearer token, you can then login.


    ```

    api_key = <TOKEN>

    request_header = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'
    }

    contacts_url = 'https://api.packetfabric.com/v2/contacts'

    r = requests.get(contacts_url, headers=request_header)

    ```

        Cloud router connections are not supported yet.


        This is the first step to receive a real-time event stream via

        [Server-sent
        Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).


        In this POST request, you declare which types of events and categories
        of those event

        types you wish to stream. Assuming your request is valid, the response
        will contain a

        `subscription_uuid` that you will use as a path parameter for the
        *Stream Events* `/v2/events/{uuid}`

        endpoint described below.


        Each subscription bundle is permanently associated with the session that
        created it and can

        only be streamed within that session. This includes subscription bundles
        created using API

        Keys (`/v2/api-keys`). Further, you must begin streaming your new
        subscription bundle within

        5 minutes of creation or it will expire. However, once you begin
        streaming a particular

        bundle it will be valid until the session associated with it expires.


        **Make sure to fully expand the schema by clicking `>` to see the
        details for each type of payload.**
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: >-
                #/components/schemas/StreamingEventsBetaCreateSubscriptionRequest
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Subscription bundle created successfully
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: >-

  /v2/events/{uuid}:
    get:
      tags:
        - Streaming Events - Beta
      summary: Stream events
      operationId: stream_events
      description: >
        **This is a beta feature.**


        Ensure that you have created a subscription bundle using the *Create
        event subscription* `/v2/events`

        endpoint described above and that you have access to the
        `subscription_uuid` returned from that request.


        Using this `subscription_uuid`, you can now stream events in real-time
        via

        [Server-sent
        Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)
        from

        `/v2/events/{subscription_uuid}`.


        Every message that you receive will have the same basic structure of an
        `event` field and a

        `data` field. The `data` field will always be a JSON object. The below
        is an example of the

        response you would receive when one of your users authenticates with the
        PacketFabric Portal or API.

        ```

        event: customer|auth

        data: {"log_level": "info","category": "auth","event":
        "login","ip_address": "192.168.1.0","message": "User Hank Aaron logged
        in.","timestamp": "2020-06-11T19:08:10.150711"}


        ```

        The precise content of the `data` of a given message will vary widely
        depending on its particular

        type. The specifics of each are documented below.


        In order to keep the connection open, you will also receive heartbeat
        messages (`:`) if enough

        time has passed between events. Our API enforces a maximum connection
        duration of two hours,

        so any automated system that uses this endpoint will need to account for
        reconnecting periodically.


        The below is a small example client using the
        [sseclient](https://github.com/btubbs/sseclient)

        library for consuming a stream of Server-sent events. To use it, you'll
        need to install sseclient and

        [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/index.html) and be
        using Python 3.7 or later.

        You will need to set your username and password into the `username` and
        `password`

        variables near the bottom of the file as well. Also, the sseclient
        library will automatically

        reconnect when the connection is lost.


        ```

        import asyncio

        import datetime


        import requests

        from sseclient import SSEClient

        What updates are allowed for a quote is dependent on the status of the
        quote.

        Only `open` and `updating` quotes can have properties other than
        `status` updated.

        - `open` quotes
          - can transition to `cancelled` or `finalized`
          - can have other properties updated
        - `cancelled` quotes
          - cannot transition to any other status
          - no properties can be updated
          - can be duplicated
        - `finalized` quotes
          - can transition to `open` (to update properties or add/delete lines)
          - no other properties can be updated
        - `finalizing` is a state that indicates a background task is running to
        transition the quote from `open` to `finalized`

        - `updating` is a state that indicates a background task is running, but
        the quote can otherwise be considered `open`
