      `Settings` is a list of all the __customization__ possible for an index.

      It is possible to update all the settings in one go or individually with
      the dedicated routes. Updates in the settings route are __partial__. This
      means that any parameters not provided in the body will be left unchanged.

      Updating the settings means overwriting the default settings of
      Meilisearch. You can reset to default values using the `DELETE` routes.

      Documents are objects composed of fields that can store any type of data.

      Each field contains an attribute and its associated value.

      Documents are stored inside
      [indexes](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/indexes.html).

      Manage API `keys` for a Meilisearch instance. Each key has a given set of
      permissions.

      You must have the master key or the default admin key to access the `keys`
      route.

      rights](https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/security.html).

      Meilisearch exposes 3 routes to perform document searches:

      * A POST route: this is the preferred route when using API authentication,
      as it allows [preflight
      request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request)
      caching and better performances.

      * A GET route: the usage of this route is discouraged, unless you have
      good reason to do otherwise (specific caching abilities for example).

      Other than the differences mentioned above, the two routes are strictly
      equivalent.

      * A POST multi-search route allowing to perform multiple search queries in
      a single HTTP request.

      Meilisearch exposes 1 route to perform facet searches:

      * A POST facet-search route allowing to perform a facet search query on a
      facet in a single HTTP request.

      The `tasks` route gives information about the progress of the
      [asynchronous
      operations](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/advanced/asynchronous_operations.html).

      `Stats` gives extended information and metrics about indexes and the

      The `experimental-features` endpoint allows enabling and disabling
      [experimental
      features](https://github.com/meilisearch/engine-team/blob/main/resources/experimental-features.md)
      at runtime.

      Experimental features are features that are not yet covered by
      [Meilisearch's stability
      guarantee](https://github.com/meilisearch/engine-team/blob/main/resources/versioning-policy.md)
      and that could break between minor and patch Meilisearch versions.

      The `dumps` route allows the creation of database dumps. Dumps are `.dump`
      files that can be used to launch Meilisearch. Dumps are compatible between
      Meilisearch versions.

      Creating a dump is also referred to as exporting it, whereas launching
      Meilisearch with a dump is referred to as importing it.

      During a [dump
      export](https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/api/dump.html#create-a-dump),
      all indexes of the current instance are exported—together with their
      documents and settings—and saved as a single `.dump` file.

      During a dump import, all indexes contained in the indicated `.dump` file
      are imported along with their associated documents and settings. Any
      existing index with the same uid as an index in the dump file will be
      overwritten.

      Dump imports are [performed at
      launch](https://docs.meilisearch.com/reference/features/configuration.html#import-dump)
      using an option.
    name: Dumps
  - description: >
      The `snapshots` route allows the creation of database snapshots. Snapshots
      are `.snapshot` files that can be used to launch Meilisearch.

      Creating a snapshot is also referred to as exporting it, whereas launching
      Meilisearch with a snapshot is referred to as importing it.

      During a snapshot export, all indexes of the current instance are
      exported—together with their documents and settings—and saved as a single
      `.snapshot` file.

      During a snapshot import, all indexes contained in the indicated
      `.snapshot` file are imported along with their associated documents and
      settings.

      Snapshot imports are performed at launch using an option.

                          The Bridge of San Luis Rey is American author Thornton
                          Wilder's second novel, first published in 1927 to
                          worldwide acclaim. It tells the story of several
                          interrelated people who die in the collapse of an Inca
                          rope-fiber suspension bridge in Peru, and the events
                          that lead up to their being on the bridge.[ A friar
                          who has witnessed the tragic accident then goes about
                          inquiring into the lives of the victims, seeking some
                          sort of cosmic answer to the question of why each had
                          to die. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928.

                          Wilder's second novel, first published in 1927 to
                          worldwide acclaim. It tells the story of several
                          interrelated people who die in the collapse of an Inca
                          rope-fiber suspension bridge in Peru, and the events
                          that lead up to their being on the bridge.[ A friar
                          who has witnessed the tragic accident then goes about
                          inquiring into the lives of the victims, seeking some
                          sort of cosmic answer to the question of why each had
                          to die. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928.

        This is the preferred route to perform search when an API key is
        required, as it allows for [preflight
        requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request)
        to be cached. Caching preflight requests improves considerably the speed
        of the search.

        To add your own ranking rule, you have to communicate either `asc` for
        ascending order or `desc` for descending order followed by the field
        name in brackets.


        * To apply an ascending custom ranking rule: `attribute_name:asc`

        * To apply a descending custom ranking rule: `attribute_name:desc`
