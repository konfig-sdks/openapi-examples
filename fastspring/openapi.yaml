    The FastSpring API and its supported requests, data, endpoints, and rate
    limits.


    The FastSpring API is a backend service you can use to communicate with your
    FastSpring Store programmatically. It requires basic understanding of HTTP
    communication methods. The primary API communication methods include:

    - **GET** - request data from your store

    - **POST** - send data to your store, such as creating a new product record

    - **DELETE** - remove data from your store


    The structure of the JSON data sent and received using the API is very
    similar to Webhooks. However, using the FastSpring API, you initiate all
    communication with your FastSpring Store.


    If you prefer a client-side method of communicating with your FastSpring
    Store and generating dynamic webpage content, check out the [Store Builder
    Library](https://fastspring.com/docs/get-started-with-store-builder-library/).


    ## Access the API


    #### API Credentials and Authentication


    FastSpring API credentials consist of a single username and password for
    your entire Store. The username and password are used for [Basic
    Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
    when making requests to the API.


    #### Obtain Your API Credentials


    1. Log on to the FastSpring App and navigate to
    [Integrations](https://fastspring.com/docs/integrations) > **API
    Credentials**. Initially, the only option on this page is the **Create**
    command.


    2. Click **Create** to generate your API **Username** and **Password**. The
    page automatically refreshes, and then your credentials are displayed.


    3. Make a note of the credentials and store them securely.


    The API credentials allow complete access and control over your FastSpring
    Store. You will not be able to view the password in the FastSpring App after
    this session. If you forget your API credentials, you can reset them,
    however any of your stored procedures that rely on API access must be
    updated immediately with the new credentials. Otherwise, the API requests
    will fail.


    ## API Requests


    **Make all requests to https://api.fastspring.com**


    When you make your requests, consider the following:

    - Ensure that the HTTP methods for all calls use uppercase letters (“GET,”
    “POST,” “DELETE”) Lowercase letters may result in a 404 error response.

    - FastSpring requires TLS 1.2 (or later) encryption for all calls to the
    FastSpring API. 

    - The API requires a **User-Agent** header in all requests. If your request
    does not include it, you may receive an 401 error message when attempting to
    make API requests.

    - The API uses basic authentication and does not support URL-encoded
    authentication. Use **Base64** to encode your username and password in the
    header.

      This article provides information about the /orders endpoint of the
      FastSpring API.


      Use the **/orders** API endpoint to retrieve information about a single
      order or retrieve a list of multiple orders matching a set of criteria.


      You can retrieve orders by order ID, product path, or date range. You can
      optionally combine parameters in your request, for example, retrieving all
      orders for a particular product that occurred in a given date range.


      When retrieving multiple orders, the API paginates the response with a
      limit of 50 records per page by default. To assist with paging through the
      results, you can optionally specify a custom limit to the number of
      records per page, and the desired **page** number in your request.

      Use the /data/v1/ to generate sync or async reports based on the flag
      "async". Also available to download and verify job status.


      ### To take into account in the requests to generate the reports:

      If **async** flag is not specified in the request, the report will be
      generated as async = false as long as days between startDate and endDate
      are not greater than 90.


      If **pageCount** is not specified in the request, it will take 1000 as
      default. pageCount and pageNumber are used only when "async": false


      - **filter.startDate** - Only return results after this date


      - **filter.endDate** - Only return results before this date


      - **filter.productNames** - Optional. Only return items with these product
      names


      - **filter.productPaths** - Optional. Only return items with these product
      paths


      - **filter.countryISO** - Optional. Only return items with these country
      ISO


      - **filter.segments** - Optional. Only return items with these segments


      - **filter.syncDate** - Optional. Only return updated items before this
      date


      - **groupBy** - Optional. Aggregate results by these columns. If no
      groupBy is included this returns raw data. If the reportColumns filter is
      used a non-numerical column when using the groupBy filter, it will be
      automatically used in the groupBy even if that column is not in the
      groupBy filter.


      - **pageCount** - Optional. The max number of records to return per page.
      Max value is 1k when async = false. 


      - **pageNumber** - Optional. 0 based page number.


      - **async** - Optional. Flag to define if the report will be generated
      asynchronous or not.


      - **reportColumns** - Optional. List of columns to include in the report. 
      Excluding this will return all columns without using groupBy filter. If
      the groupBy filter is used, the data service will just return columns used
      in the groupBy and the requested in reportColumns filter as well.


      - **notificationEmails** - Optional. List of emails to notify when report
      is generated by using the flag async = true.

      Use the **/accounts** endpoint of the FastSpring API to create, update, or

      Use the /events endpoint to retrieve the payloads for passed webhook
      events. Events are either processed or unprocessed, depending on whether
      the webhook endpoint has acknowledged the handling of the event.

      A session may contain discounts, price overrides, custom tags, and more.
      When you create a session via the [FastSpring
      API](https://fastspring.com/docs/fastspring-api), the response from the
      API includes the session ID, which you can use to collect payment. A
      customer cannot change the details of the session. A successful payment
      via the session creates an order record.


      ### Session Behavior


      - **Expiration:** Sessions created via the /sessions endpoint are valid
      for 24 hours by default and up to 7 days if specified. Use "expiration"
      with a value between 1 and 7 to represents the number of days to remain
      valid.


      - **Customer Accounts:** Posts to the /sessions endpoint require an
      existing customer account. If your customer has purchased from you
      previously and you have obtained the customer's FastSpring-generated
      account ID, you can pass that into the POST. Otherwise, you need to
      pre-create an account with the customer's name and email address via the
      API. See [/accounts](https://fastspring.com/docs/accounts).


      - **Products Allowed:** Each session or order can only contain a single
      occurrence of any given product or its [product
      variations](https://fastspring.com/docs/product-variations). If you
      include more than one variation of the same product in a single session,
      it will result in an error 400 with the message "Item exists."


      - **Session Object:** The recipient object used with the [Store Builder
      Library session
      object](https://fastspring.com/docs/access-the-library-with-javascript/#AccessingtheLibraryfromJavascript-sessionUnderstandingtheSessionObject) 
      and fastspring.builder.recognizeRecipients() method is not currently
      supported via the /sessions API endpoint. It is not possible to pre-fill
      [gift recipient](https://fastspring.com/docs/gift-purchases/) information
      via the /sessions endpoint.


      - **Customer Country:** The account country is required for certain
      non-credit card payment methods so be sure the customer account includes
      the customer's country. Transactions based on sessions could fail if the
      country is not included in the customer's account.


      An example to use the /sessions API endpoint is to provide customers with
      an option to pay what you want. Design your website to accept price data
      from your customers and use the /sessions endpoint to create a session
      that overrides the default prices. Alternatively, you can do this using a
      [secure
      request](https://fastspring.com/docs/passing-sensitive-data-with-secure-requests)
      via the [Store Builder
      Library](https://fastspring.com/docs/get-started-with-store-builder-library/).
