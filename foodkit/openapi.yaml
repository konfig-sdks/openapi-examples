        Use this endpoint to retrieve the complete list of branches (AKA

        the timestamp. You can then check this endpoint periodically and only
        refresh the branch list locally if the timestamp has changed since your
        last check.

        Use this endpoint to retrieve all publications for a tenant.
        "Publications" include any content that should be publicly visible
        through your customer facing channels (e.g: websites and/or
        applications). Restaurants can use publications to advertise offers,
        promotions, or to make announcements. Note that data is not returned
        directly. Rather this endpoint provides a URL to the latest list of
        publications and an associated "last update" timestamp. To optimise
        performance (and prevent rate limiting) you should cache the
        publications list locally and check the timestamp periodically. If the
        timestamp changes you should invalidate your local cache and fetch the
        list again from the provided `url` using a standard GET request.
