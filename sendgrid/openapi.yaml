        **This endpoint allows you to remove one or more IP addresses from your
        list of allowed addresses.**


        To remove one or more IP addresses, pass this endpoint an array
        containing the ID(s) associated with the IP(s) you intend to remove. You
        can retrieve the IDs associated with your allowed IP addresses using the
        "Retrieve a list of currently allowed IPs" endpoint.


        It is possible to remove your own IP address, which will block access to
        your account. You will need to submit a [support
        ticket](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/support/) if
        this happens. For this reason, it is important to double check that you
        are removing only the IPs you intend to remove when using this endpoint.

        A successful response from this API will include all available API keys'
        names and IDs.


        For security reasons, there is not a way to retrieve the key itself
        after it's created. If you lose your API key, you must create a new one.
        Only the "Create API keys" endpoint will return a key to you and only at
        the time of creation.


        An `api_key_id` can be used to update or delete the key, as well as
        retrieve the key's details, such as its scopes.

        **This endpoint allows you to create a new API Key for the user.**


        To create your initial SendGrid API Key, you should [use the SendGrid
        App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). Once you have created
        a first key with scopes to manage additional API keys, you can use this
        API for all other key management.


        > There is a limit of 100 API Keys on your account.


        A JSON request body containing a `name` property is required when making
        requests to this endpoint. If the number of maximum keys, 100, is
        reached, a `403` status will be returned.


        Though the `name` field is required, it does not need to be unique. A
        unique API key ID will be generated for each key you create and returned
        in the response body.


        It is not necessary to pass a `scopes` field to the API when creating a
        key, but you should be aware that omitting the `scopes` field from your
        request will create a key with "Full Access" permissions by default.


        See the [API Key Permissions
        List](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/api-authorization)
        for all available scopes. An API key's scopes can be updated after
        creation using the "Update API keys" endpoint.

        If a recipient uses the "one-click unsubscribe" option on an email
        associated with a deleted group, that recipient will be added to the
        global suppression list.


        Deleting a suppression group will remove the suppression, meaning email
        will once again be sent to the previously suppressed addresses. This
        should be avoided unless a recipient indicates they wish to receive
        email from you again. You can use our [bypass
        filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions)
        to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions
        are required.

        If you have the flexibility, it's better to schedule mail for off-peak
        times. Most emails are scheduled and sent at the top of the hour or half
        hour. Scheduling email to avoid those times (for example, scheduling at
        10:53) can result in lower deferral rates because it won't be going
        through our servers at the same times as everyone else's mail.

        field_name:


        * is a variable that is substituted for your actual custom field name
        from your recipient.

        * Text fields must be url-encoded. Date fields are searchable only by
        unix timestamp (e.g. 2/2/2015 becomes 1422835200)

        * If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such as created_at or
        updated_at, the system will internally convert

        your epoch time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For
        example, an epoch time of 1422835600 converts to

        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the system will search
        from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT through

        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 23:59:59 GMT.

        **This endpoint allows you to create a new segment.**


          Valid operators for create and update depend on the type of the field for which you are searching.

        **Dates**

        - "eq", "ne", "lt" (before), "gt" (after)
            - You may use MM/DD/YYYY for day granularity or an epoch for second granularity.
        - "empty", "not_empty"

        - "is within"
            - You may use an [ISO 8601 date format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) or the # of days.

        **Text**

        - "contains"

        - "eq" (is/equals - matches the full field)

        - "ne" (is not/not equals - matches any field where the entire field is
        not the condition value)

        - "empty"

        - "not_empty"


        **Numbers**

        - "eq" (is/equals)

        - "lt" (is less than)

        - "gt" (is greater than)

        - "empty"

        - "not_empty"


        **Email Clicks and Opens**

        - "eq" (opened)

        - "ne" (not opened)


        All field values must be a string.



        Conditions using "eq" or "ne" for email clicks and opens should provide
        a "field" of either `clicks.campaign_identifier` or
        `opens.campaign_identifier`.

        The condition value should be a string containing the id of a completed
        campaign.



        The conditions list may contain multiple conditions, joined by an "and"
        or "or" in the "and_or" field.


        The first condition in the conditions list must have an empty "and_or",
        and subsequent conditions must all specify an "and_or".

        **This endpoint allows you to create a new design**.


        You can add a new design by passing data, including a string of HTML
        email content, to `/designs`. When creating designs from scratch, be
        aware of the styling constraints inherent to many email clients. For a
        list of best practices, see our guide to [Cross-Platform Email
        Design](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/cross-platform-html-design/).


        The Design Library can also convert your design’s HTML elements into
        drag and drop modules that are editable in the Designs Library user
        interface. For more, visit the [Design and Code Editor
        documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/editor/#drag--drop-markup).


        Because the `/designs` endpoint makes it easy to add designs, you can
        create a design with your preferred tooling or migrate designs you
        already own without relying on the Design Library UI.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of pre-built designs
        provided by Twilio SendGrid**.


        Unlike the `/designs` endpoint where *your* designs are stored, a GET
        request made to `designs/pre-builts` will retrieve a list of the
        pre-built Twilio SendGrid designs. This endpoint will not return the
        designs stored in your Design Library.


        By default, you will receive 100 results per request; however, you can
        modify the number of results returned by passing an integer to the
        `page_size` query parameter.


        This endpoint is useful for retrieving the IDs of Twilio SendGrid
        designs that you want to duplicate and modify.

        **This endpoint allows you to duplicate one of the pre-built Twilio
        SendGrid designs**.


        Like duplicating one of your existing designs, you are not required to
        pass any data in the body of a request to this endpoint. If you choose
        to leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the
        name of the design it was copied from with the text "Duplicate: "
        prepended to it. This name change is only a convenience, as the
        duplicate design will be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it
        from your other designs. You can retrieve the IDs for Twilio SendGrid
        pre-built designs using the "List SendGrid Pre-built Designs" endpoint.


        You can modify your duplicate’s name at the time of creation by passing
        an updated value to the `name` field when making the initial request.

        More on retrieving design IDs can be found above.

                      from vibrant, local experiences. We want to discover the
                      hidden gems and less-traveled roads of our next
                      destination.

        **This endpoint allows you to edit a design**.


        The Design API supports PATCH requests, which allow you to make partial
        updates to a single design. Passing data to a specific field will update
        only the data stored in that field; all other fields will be unaltered.


        For example, updating a design's name requires that you make a PATCH
        request to this endpoint with data specified for the `name` field only.


        ```

        {
            "name": "<Updated Name>"
        }

        ```

        **This endpoint allows you to duplicate one of your existing designs**.


        Modifying an existing design is often the easiest way to create
        something new.


        You are not required to pass any data in the body of a request to this
        endpoint. If you choose to leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate
        will be assigned the name of the design it was copied from with the text
        "Duplicate: " prepended to it. This name change is only a convenience,
        as the duplicate will be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it
        from your other designs.


        You can modify your duplicate’s name at the time of creation by passing
        an updated value to the `name` field when making the initial request.

        More on retrieving design IDs can be found below.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your email statistics segmented
        by country and state/province.**


        **We only store up to 7 days of email activity in our database.** By
        default, 500 items will be returned per request via the Advanced Stats
        API endpoints.


        Advanced Stats provide a more in-depth view of your email statistics and
        the actions taken by your recipients. You can segment these statistics
        by geographic location, device type, client type, browser, and mailbox
        provider. For more information about statistics, please see our [User
        Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Statistics/index.html).

        **This endpoint allows you to generate a new batch ID.**


        Once a `batch_id` is created, you can associate it with a scheduled send
        using the `/mail/send` endpoint. Passing the `batch_id` as a field in
        the `/mail/send` request body will assign the ID to the send you are
        creating.


        Once an ID is associated with a scheduled send, the send can be accessed
        and its send status can be modified using the `batch_id`.

        When you pass a valid `batch_id` to this endpoint, it will return a
        `200` status code and the batch ID itself.


        If you pass an invalid `batch_id` to the endpoint, you will receive a
        `400` level status code and an error message.


        A `batch_id` does not need to be assigned to a scheduled send to be
        considered valid. A successful response means only that the `batch_id`
        has been created, but it does not indicate that it has been associated
        with a send.

        The Mail Send endpoint allows you to send email over SendGrid’s v3 Web
        API, the most recent version of our API. If you are looking for
        documentation about the v2 Mail Send endpoint, see our [v2 API
        Reference](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html).


        ## Helper Libraries


        Twilio SendGrid provides libraries to help you quickly and easily
        integrate with the v3 Web API in 7 different languages:


        * [C#](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp) 

        * [Go](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go)

        * [Java](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java)

        * [Node JS](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs)

        * [PHP](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php)

        * [Python](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python)

        * [Ruby](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby)


        ## Dynamic Transactional Templates and Handlebars


        In order to send a dynamic template, specify the template ID with the
        `template_id` parameter. 


        To specify handlebar substitutions, define your substitutions in the
        request JSON with this syntax:


        ```

        "dynamic_template_data": {

              "guest": "Jane Doe",

              "partysize": "4",

              "english": true,

              "date": "April 1st, 2021"

            }

        ```


        For more information about Dynamic Transactional Templates and
        Handlebars, see our documentation and reference pages.

        Handlebars](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars/) 


        ## Mail Body Compression


        Mail body compression is available to some high volume accounts. Talk to
        your CSM if you are interested in this functionality. Mail body
        compression works by setting up a JSON payload as defined on this page,
        then compressing it with gzip (the gzip file can be no more than 30mb).


        To use mail body compression:


        1. Add a `Content-Encoding` header, with a value of `gzip`.  
           a. `Content-Encoding: gzip` 
        2. Send the gzip as a data-binary.  
           a. `--data-binary '@data.json.gz'
        `


        ## Multiple Reply-To Emails


        Using `reply_to_list` allows senders to include more than one recipient
        email address to receive reply and/or bounce messages from the recipient
        of the email.


        ### Usage Considerations


        * `reply_to` is mutually exclusive with `reply_to_list`. If both are
        used, then the API call will be rejected. 

        * The `reply_to_list` object, when used, must at least have an email
        parameter and may also contain a name parameter.

        * Each email address in the `reply_to_list` should be unique.

        * There is a limit of 1000 `reply_to_list` emails per mail/send request.

        * In SMTP calls, we will omit any invalid emails.


        ### Possible 400 Error Messages


        * `reply_to` is mutually exclusive with `reply_to_list`.

        * The `reply_to_list` object, when used, must at least have an email
        parameter and may also contain a name parameter.

        * Each email address in the `reply_to_list` should be unique.

        * There is a limit of X `reply_to` emails per mail/send request.

        * The `reply_to_list` email does not contain a valid address.

        * The `reply_to_list` email exceeds the maximum total length of X
        characters.

        * The `reply_to_list` email parameter is required.

        **This endpoint allows you to update your current email address
        whitelist settings.**


        You can select whether or not this setting should be enabled by
        assigning the `enabled` field a `true` or `false` value.


        Passing only the `enabled` field to this endpoint will not alter your
        current `list` of whitelist entries. However, any modifications to your
        `list` of entries will overwrite the entire list. For this reason, you
        must included all existing entries you wish to retain in your `list` in
        addition to any new entries you intend to add. To remove one or more
        `list` entries, pass a `list` with only the entries you wish to retain.


        You should not add generic domains such as `gmail.com` or `yahoo.com` 
        in your `list` because your emails will not honor recipients'
        unsubscribes. This may cause a legal violation of
        [CAN-SPAM](https://sendgrid.com/docs/glossary/can-spam/) and could
        damage your sending reputation.


        The Address Whitelist setting allows you to specify email addresses or
        domains for which mail should never be suppressed.


        For example, if you own the domain `example.com`, and one or more of
        your recipients use `email@example.com` addresses, placing `example.com`
        in the address whitelist setting instructs Twilio SendGrid to ignore all
        bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain. In other
        words, all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes will still be sent to
        `example.com` as if they were sent under normal sending conditions.

        The Bounce Perge setting allows you to set a schedule that Twilio
        SendGrid will use to automatically delete contacts from your soft and
        hard bounce suppression lists.


        A hard bounce occurs when an email message has been returned to the
        sender because the recipient's address is invalid. A hard bounce might
        occur because the domain name doesn't exist or because the recipient is
        unknown.


        A soft bounce occurs when an email message reaches the recipient's mail
        server but is bounced back undelivered before it actually reaches the
        recipient. A soft bounce might occur because the recipient's inbox is
        full.

        **This endpoint allows you to update your current bounce and purge
        settings.**


        The Bounce Perge setting allows you to set a schedule that Twilio
        SendGrid will use to automatically delete contacts from your soft and
        hard bounce suppression lists. The schedule is set in full days by
        assigning the number of days, an integer, to the `soft_bounces` and/or
        `hard_bounces` fields.


        A hard bounce occurs when an email message has been returned to the
        sender because the recipient's address is invalid. A hard bounce might
        occur because the domain name doesn't exist or because the recipient is
        unknown.


        A soft bounce occurs when an email message reaches the recipient's mail
        server but is bounced back undelivered before it actually reaches the
        recipient. A soft bounce might occur because the recipient's inbox is
        full.


        You can also manage this setting in the [Mail Settings section of the
        Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings).
        You can manage your bounces manually using the [Bounces
        API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/bounces-api) or the [Bounces menu

        settings.**


        Enabling the Forward Spam setting allows you to specify `email`
        addresses to which spam reports will be forwarded. You can set multiple
        addresses by passing this endpoint a comma separated list of emails in a
        single string.


        ```

        {
          "email": "address1@example.com, address2@exapmle.com",
          "enabled": true
        }

        ```


        The Forward Spam setting may also be used to receive emails sent to
        `abuse@` and `postmaster@` role addresses if you have authenticated your
        domain.


        For example, if you authenticated `example.com` as your root domain and
        set a custom return path of `sub` for that domain, you could turn on
        Forward Spam, and any emails sent to `abuse@sub.example.com` or
        `postmaster@sub.example.com` would be forwarded to the email address you
        entered in the `email` field.


        You can authenticate your domain using the "Authenticate a domain"
        endpoint or in the [Sender Authentication section of the Twilio SendGrid
        App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth). You can also
        configure the Forward Spam mail settings in the [Mail Settings section

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your email statistics segmented
        by recipient mailbox provider.**


        **We only store up to 7 days of email activity in our database.** By

        the actions taken by your recipients. You can segment these statistics
        by geographic location, device type, client type, browser, and mailbox
        provider. For more information about statistics, please see our
        [Statistics

        **This endpoint allows the
        [upsert](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upsert) (insert or update) of up
        to 30,000 contacts, or 6MB of data, whichever is lower**. 


        Because the creation and update of contacts is an asynchronous process,
        the response will not contain immediate feedback on the processing of
        your upserted contacts. Rather, it will contain an HTTP 202 response
        indicating the contacts are queued for processing or an HTTP 4XX error
        containing validation errors. Should you wish to get the resulting
        contact's ID or confirm your contacts have been updated or added, you
        can use the "Get Contacts by Emails" endpoint. 


        Please note that custom fields need to have been already created if you
        wish to set their values for the contacts being upserted. To do this,
        please use the "Create Custom Field Definition" endpoint.


        You will see a `job_id` in the response to your request. This can be
        used to check the status of your upsert job. To do so, please use the
        "Import Contacts Status" endpoint.


        If the contact already exists in the system, any entries submitted via
        this endpoint will update the existing contact. The contact to update
        will be determined only by the `email` field and any fields omitted from
        the request will remain as they were. A contact's ID cannot be used to
        update the contact.


        The email field will be changed to all lower-case. If a contact is added
        with an email that exists but contains capital letters, the existing
        contact with the all lower-case email will be updated.

        It will return an array of objects, each of which records an export job
        in flight or recently completed. 


        Each object's `export_type` field will tell you which kind of export it
        is and its `status` field will indicate what stage of processing it has
        reached. Exports which are `ready` will be accompanied by a `urls` field
        which lists the URLs of the export's downloadable files — there will be
        more than one if you specified a maximum file size in your initial
        export request.


        Use this endpoint if you have exports in flight but do not know their
        IDs, which are required for the "Export Contacts Status" endpoint.

        If you would just like to have a link to the exported list sent to your
        email set the `notifications.email` option to `true` in the `POST`
        payload.


        If you would like to download the list, take the `id` that is returned
        and use the "Export Contacts Status" endpoint to get the `urls`. Once
        you have the list of URLs, make a `GET` request to each URL provided to
        download your CSV file(s).


        You specify the segements and or/contact lists you wish to export by
        providing the relevant IDs in, respectively, the `segment_ids` and
        `list_ids` fields in the request body.


        The lists will be provided in either JSON or CSV files. To specify which
        of these you would required, set the request body `file_type` field to
        `json` or `csv`.


        You can also specify a maximum file size (in MB). If the export file is
        larger than this, it will be split into multiple files.

        To use this call, you will need the `id` from the "Export Contacts"
        call.


        If you would like to download a list, take the `id` that is returned
        from the "Export Contacts" endpoint and make an API request here to get
        the `urls`. Once you have the list of URLs, make a `GET` request on each
        URL to download your CSV file(s).

        **This endpoint allows a CSV upload containing up to one million
        contacts or 5GB of data, whichever is smaller.**


        Imports take place asynchronously: the endpoint returns a URL
        (`upload_uri`) and HTTP headers (`upload_headers`) which can
        subsequently be used to `PUT` a file of contacts to be  imported into
        our system.


        Uploaded CSV files may also be
        [gzip-compressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip).


        In either case, you must include the field `file_type` with the value
        `csv` in your request body.


        The `field_mappings` paramter is a respective list of field definition
        IDs to map the uploaded CSV columns to. It allows you to use CSVs where
        one or more columns are skipped (`null`) or remapped to the contact
        field. 


        For example, if `field_mappings` is set to `[null, "w1", "_rf1"]`, this
        means skip column 0, map column 1 to the custom field with the ID `w1`,
        and map column 2 to the reserved field with the ID `_rf1`. See the "Get
        All Field Definitions" endpoint to fetch your custom and reserved field
        IDs to use with `field_mappings`.


        Once you recieve the response body you can then initiate a **second**
        API call where you use the supplied URL and HTTP header to upload your
        file. For example:


        `curl --upload-file "file/path.csv" "URL_GIVEN" -H 'HEADER_GIVEN'`


        If you'd like to monitor the status of your import job, use the `job_id`
        and the "Import Contacts Status" endpoint.

        job**. 


        Use the `job_id` from the "Import Contacts," "Add or Update a Contact,"
        or "Delete Contacts" endpoints as the `id` in the path parameter.


        If there is an error with your `PUT` request, download the `errors_url`
        file and open it to view more details.


        The job `status` field indicates whether the job is `pending`,
        `completed`, `errored`, or `failed`. 


        Pending means not started. Completed means finished without any errors.
        Errored means finished with some errors. Failed means finshed with all
        errors, or the job was entirely unprocessable: for example, if you
        attempt to import file format we do not support.


        The `results` object will have fields depending on the job type.

        The request body's `query` field accepts valid
        [SGQL](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/segmentation-query-language/)
        for searching for a contact.


        Because contact emails are stored in lower case, using SGQL to search by
        email address requires the provided email address to be in lower case.
        The SGQL `lower()` function can be used for this.


        Only the first 50 contacts that meet the search criteria will be
        returned.


        If the query takes longer than 20 seconds, a `408 Request Timeout`
        status will be returned.


        Formatting the `created_at` and `updated_at` values as Unix timestamps
        is deprecated. Instead they are returned as ISO format as string.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve up to 100 contacts matching the
        searched `email` address(es), including any `alternate_emails`.** 


        Email addresses are unique to a contact, meaning this endpoint can treat
        an email address as a primary key to search by. The contact object
        associated with the address, whether it is their `email` or one of their
        `alternate_emails` will be returned if matched.


        Email addresses in the search request do not need to match the case in
        which they're stored, but the email addresses in the result will be all
        lower case. Empty strings are excluded from the search and will not be
        returned.


        This endpoint should be used in place of the "Search Contacts" endpoint
        when you can provide exact email addresses and do not need to include
        other [Segmentation Query Language
        (SGQL)](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/segmentation-query-language/)
        filters when searching.


        If you need to access a large percentage of your contacts, we recommend
        exporting your contacts with the "Export Contacts" endpoint and
        filtering the results client side.


        This endpoint returns a `200` status code when any contacts match the
        address(es) you supplied. When searching multiple addresses in a single
        request, it is possible that some addresses will match a contact while
        others will not. When a partially successful search like this is made,
        the matching contacts are returned in an object and an error message is
        returned for the email address(es) that are not found. 


        This endpoint returns a `404` status code when no contacts are found for
        the provided email address(es).


        A `400` status code is returned if any searched addresses are invalid.

        **This endpoint creates a new custom field definition.**


        Custom field definitions are created with the given `name` and
        `field_type`. Although field names are stored in a case-sensitive
        manner, all field names must be case-insensitively unique. This means
        you may create a field named `CamelCase` or `camelcase`, but not both.
        Additionally, a Custom Field name cannot collide with any Reserved Field
        names. You should save the returned `id` value in order to update or
        delete the field at a later date. You can have up to 120 custom fields.


        The custom field name should be created using only alphanumeric
        characters (A-Z and 0-9) and underscores (\_). Custom fields can only
        begin with letters  A-Z or underscores (_). The field type can be date,
        text, or number fields. The field type is important for creating
        segments from your contact database.


        **Note: Creating a custom field that begins with a number will cause
        issues with sending in Marketing Campaigns.**

        **This endpoint allows you to duplicate an existing Single Send using
        its Single Send ID.**


        Duplicating a Single Send is useful when you want to create a Single
        Send but don't want to start from scratch. Once duplicated, you can
        update or edit the Single Send by making a PATCH request to the
        `/marketing/singlesends/{id}` endpoint.
         
        If you leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the
        name of the Single Send it was copied from with the text “Copy of ”
        prepended to it. The `name` field length is limited to 100 characters,
        so the end of the new Single Send name, including “Copy of ”, will be
        trimmed if the name exceeds this limit.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve stats for an individual Single
        Send using a Single Send ID.**


        Multiple Single Send IDs can be retrieved using the "Get All Single
        Sends Stats" endpoint. Once you have an ID, this endpoint will return
        detailed stats for the Single Send specified.


        You may constrain the stats returned using the `start_date` and
        `end_date` query string parameters. You can also use the `group_by` and
        `aggregated_by` query string parameters to further refine the stats
        returned.

        **This endpoint lets you retrieve click-tracking stats for one Single
        Send**.


        The stats returned list the URLs embedded in the specified Single Send
        and the number of clicks each one received.


        Responses are paginated. You can limit the number of responses returned
        per batch using the `page_size` query string parameter. The default is
        50, but you specify a value between 1 and 100.


        You can retrieve a specific page of responses with the `page_token`
        query string parameter.

        **This endpoint allows you to send a test marketing email to a list of
        email addresses**.


        Before sending a marketing message, you can test it using this endpoint.
        You may specify up to **10 contacts** in the `emails` request body
        field. You must also specify a `template_id` and include either a
        `from_address` or `sender_id`. You can manage your templates with the
        [Twilio SendGrid App](https://mc.sendgrid.com/dynamic-templates) or the
        [Transactional Templates
        API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/transactional-templates).


        > Please note that this endpoint works with Dynamic Transactional
        Templates only. Legacy Transactional Templates will not be delivered.


        For more information about managing Dynamic Transactional Templates, see
        [How to Send Email with Dynamic Transactional
        Templates](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-transactional-templates/).


        You can also test your Single Sends in the [Twilio SendGrid Marketing
        Campaigns UI](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends).

        This is **BETA** functionality. You may not have access, and we reserve
        the right to change functionality without notice.


        Filter all messages to search your Email Activity. All queries need to
        be [URL encoded](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/), and have
        this format:


        `query={query_type}="{query_content}"`


        encoded, this would look like this:


        `query=type%3D%22query_content%22`


        for example:


        Filter by a specific email -
        `query=to_email%3D%22example%40example.com%22`


        Filter by subject line - `query=subject%3d%22A%20Great%20Subject%22`


        **Full list of basic query types and examples:**



        | **Filter query**    | **Unencoded Example** (put this one into the try
        it out query - it'll automatically encode it for you) | **Encoded
        Example** (use this one in your code)                        |

        This request will kick off a backend process to generate a CSV file.
        Once generated, the worker will then send an email for the user download
        the file. The link will expire in 3 days.


        The CSV fill contain the last 1 million messages. This endpoint will be
        rate limited to 1 request every 12 hours (rate limit may change).


        This endpoint is similar to the GET Single Message endpoint - the only
        difference is that /download is added to indicate that this is a CSV
        download requests but the same query is used to determine what the CSV
        should contain.

        API Keys are used to authenticate with [SendGrid's v3
        API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/api-authorization).


        API Keys may be assigned certain permissions, or scopes, that limit
        which API endpoints they are able to access.


        This endpoint returns all the scopes assigned to the key you use to
        authenticate with it. To retrieve the scopes assigned to another key,
        you can pass an API key ID to the "Retrieve an existing API key"
        endpoint.


        For a more detailed explanation of how you can use API Key permissions,
        please visit our [API Keys
        documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/).

        Each subuser should be assigned to an IP address from which all of this

        There are two options for deleting invalid email addresses: 


        1) You can delete all invalid email addresses by setting `delete_all` to
        true in the request body.

        2) You can delete some invalid email addresses by specifying certain
        addresses in an array in the request body.

        Deleting a spam report will remove the suppression, meaning email will
        once again be sent to the previously suppressed address. This should be
        avoided unless a recipient indicates they wish to receive email from you
        again. You can use our [bypass
        filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions)
        to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions
        are required.


        There are two options for deleting spam reports: 


        1. You can delete all spam reports by setting the `delete_all` field to
        `true` in the request body.

        2. You can delete a list of select spam reports by specifying the email
        addresses in the `emails` array of the request body.

        This endpoint will return only the scheduled sends that are associated
        with a `batch_id`. If you have scheduled a send using the `/mail/send`
        endpoint and the `send_at` field but no `batch_id`, the send will be
        scheduled for delivery; however, it will not be returned by this
        endpoint. For this reason, you should assign a `batch_id` to any
        scheduled send you may need to pause or cancel in the future.

        **This endpoint allows you to cancel or pause a scheduled send
        associated with a `batch_id`.**


        Passing this endpoint a `batch_id` and status will cancel or pause the
        scheduled send.


        Once a scheduled send is set to `pause` or `cancel` you must use the
        "Update a scheduled send" endpoint to change its status or the "Delete a
        cancellation or pause from a scheduled send" endpoint to remove the
        status. Passing a status change to a scheduled send that has already
        been paused or cancelled will result in a `400` level status code.


        If the maximum number of cancellations/pauses are added to a send, a
        `400` level status code will be returned.

        SendGrid’s Event Webhook will notify a URL of your choice via HTTP POST
        with information about events that occur as SendGrid processes your
        email.


        Common uses of this data are to remove unsubscribes, react to spam
        reports, determine unengaged recipients, identify bounced email
        addresses, or create advanced analytics of your email program.


        >**Tip**: Retry logic for this endpoint differs from other endpoints,
        which use a rolling 24-hour retry.


        If your web server does not return a 2xx response type, we will retry a
        POST request until we receive a 2xx response or the maximum time of 10
        minutes has expired.

        **This endpoint allows you to create a new inbound parse setting.**


        Creating an Inbound Parse setting requires two pieces of information: a
        `url` and a `hostname`.


        The `hostname` must correspond to a domain authenticated by Twilio
        SendGrid on your account. If you need to complete domain authentication,
        you can use the [Twilio SendGrid
        App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth) or the "Authenticate
        a domain" endpoint. See "[How to Set Up Domain
        Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/)"
        for instructions.


        Any email received by the `hostname` will be parsed when you complete
        this setup. You must also add a Twilio SendGrid MX record to this
        domain's DNS records. See "[Setting up the Inbound Parse
        Webhook](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/)"
        for full instructions.


        The `url` represents a location where the parsed message data will be
        delivered. Twilio SendGrid will make an HTTP POST request to this `url`
        with the message data. The `url` must be publicly reachable, and your
        application must return a `200` status code to signal that the message
        data has been received.

        emails to a URL that you specify. The Inbound Parse Webhook cannot parse
        messages greater than 30MB in size, including all attachments.


        There are a number of pre-made integrations for the SendGrid Parse
        Webhook which make processing events easy. You can find these
        integrations in the [Library

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve all the Sender Identities
        associated with an account.**


        This endpoint will return both verified and unverified senders.


        You can limit the number of results returned using the `limit`,
        `lastSeenID`, and `id` query string parameters.


        * `limit` allows you to specify an exact number of Sender Identities to
        return.

        * `lastSeenID` will return senders with an ID number occuring after the
        passed in ID. In other words, the `lastSeenID` provides a starting point
        from which SendGrid will iterate to find Sender Identities associated
        with your account.

        * `id` will return information about only the Sender Identity passed in
        the request.

        Upon successful submission of a `POST` request to this endpoint, an
        identity will be created, and a verification email will be sent to the
        address assigned to the `from_email` field. You must complete the
        verification process using the sent email to fully verify the sender.


        If you need to resend the verification email, you can do so with the
        Resend Verified Sender Request, `/resend/{id}`, endpoint.


        If you need to authenticate a domain rather than a Single Sender, see
        the [Domain Authentication
        API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/domain-authentication/authenticate-a-domain).

        **This endpoint returns a list of domains known to implement DMARC and
        categorizes them by failure type — hard failure or soft failure**.


        Domains listed as hard failures will not deliver mail when used as a
        [Sender
        Identity](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity/)
        due to the domain's DMARC policy settings.


        For example, using a `yahoo.com` email address as a Sender Identity will
        likely result in the rejection of your mail. For more information about
        DMARC, see [Everything about
        DMARC](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/dmarc/).

        Passing the `id` assigned to a Sender Identity to this endpoint will
        resend a verification email to the `from_address` associated with the
        Sender Identity. This can be useful if someone loses their verification
        email or needs to have it resent for any other reason.


        You can retrieve the IDs associated with Sender Identities by passing a
        "Get All Verified Senders" endpoint.

        An account may have one, both, or neither verification steps completed.
        If you need to authenticate a domain rather than a Single Sender, see
        the "Authenticate a domain" endpoint.

        **This endpoint is used to share DNS records with a colleagues**


        Use this endpoint to send SendGrid-generated DNS record information to a
        co-worker so they can enter it into your DNS provider to validate your
        domain and link branding. 


        What type of records are sent will depend on whether you have chosen
        Automated Security or not. When using Automated Security, SendGrid
        provides you with three CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security
        off, you are instead given TXT and MX records.


        If you pass a `link_id` to this endpoint, the generated email will
        supply the DNS records necessary to complete [Link
        Branding](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding/)
        setup. If you pass a `domain_id` to this endpoint, the generated email
        will supply the DNS records needed to complete [Domain
        Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/).
        Passing both IDs will generate an email with the records needed to
        complete both setup steps.


        You can retrieve all your domain IDs from the returned `id` fields for
        each domain using the "List all authenticated domains" endpoint. You can
        retrieve all of your link IDs using the "Retrieve all branded links"
        endpoint.

        **This endpoint allows you to authenticate a domain.**


        If you are authenticating a domain for a subuser, you have two options:

        1. Use the "username" parameter. This allows you to authenticate a
        domain on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see
        and modify the authenticated domain.

        2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This
        allows you to authenticate a domain created by the parent to a subuser.
        This means the subuser will default to the assigned domain, but will not
        be able to see or modify that authenticated domain. However, if the
        subuser authenticates their own domain it will overwrite the assigned
        domain.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the default authentication for a
        domain.**


        When creating or updating a domain authentication, you can set the
        domain as a default. The default domain will be used to send all mail.
        If you have multiple authenticated domains, the authenticated domain
        matching the domain of the From address will be used, and the default
        will be overridden.


        This endpoint will return a default domain and its details only if a
        default is set. You are not required to set a default. If you do not set
        a default domain, this endpoint will return general information about
        your domain authentication status.

        **This endpoint allows you to associate a specific authenticated domain
        with a subuser.**


        Authenticated domains can be associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers
        from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail
        using their parent's domain authentication. To associate an
        authenticated domain with a subuser, the parent account must first
        authenticate and validate the domain. The parent may then associate the
        authenticated domain via the subuser management tools.

        You may include a search key by using the `ip` query string parameter.
        This enables you to perform a prefix search for a given IP segment
        (e.g., `?ip="192."`).


        Use the `limit` query string parameter to reduce the number of records
        returned. All records will be returned if you have fewer records than
        the specified limit.


        The `offset` query string parameter allows you to specify a non-zero
        index from which records will be returned. For example, if you have ten
        records, `?offset=5` will return the last five records (at indexes 5
        through 9). The list starts at index zero.

        Always check the `valid` property of the response’s
        `validation_results.a_record` object. This field will indicate whether
        it was possible to validate the reverse DNS record. If the
        `validation_results.a_record.valid` is `false`, this indicates only that
        Twilio SendGrid could not determine the validity your reverse DNS record
        — it may still be valid.


        If validity couldn’t be determined, you can check the value of
        `validation_results.a_record.reason` to find out why.


        You can retrieve the IDs associated with all your reverse DNS records
        using the "Retrieve all reverse DNS records" endpoint.

        domain should match your FROM email address. If you provide a 
        subdomain, it must be different from the subdomain you used for
        authenticating your domain.

        * The validated branded link marked as `default` (set when you call the
        "Create a branded link" endpoint or by calling the "Update a branded
        link" endpoint on an existing link)

        * Legacy branded links (migrated from the whitelabel wizard)

        * Default SendGrid-branded links (i.e., `100.ct.sendgrid.net`)

        Link branding can be associated with subusers from the parent account.
        This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's
        link branding. To associate link branding, the parent account must first
        create a branded link and validate it. The parent may then associate
        that branded link with a subuser via the API or the [Subuser Management
        page of the Twilio SendGrid
        App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers).


        Your request will receive a response with a 204 status code if the
        disassociation was successful.

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the branded link associated with
        a subuser.**


        Link branding can be associated with subusers from the parent account.
        This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's
        link branding. To associate link branding, the parent account must first
        create a branded link and then validate it. The parent may then
        associate that branded link with a subuser via the API or the [Subuser
        Management page of the Twilio SendGrid
        App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers).
