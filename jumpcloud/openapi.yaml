    # Directory Objects


    This API offers the ability to interact with some of our core features;
    otherwise known as Directory Objects. The Directory Objects are:


    * Commands

    * Policies

    * Policy Groups

    * Applications

    * Systems

    * Users

    * User Groups

    * System Groups

    * Radius Servers

    * Directories: Office 365, LDAP,G-Suite, Active Directory

    * Duo accounts and applications.


    The Directory Object is an important concept to understand in order to
    successfully use JumpCloud API.


    ## JumpCloud Graph


    We've also introduced the concept of the JumpCloud Graph along with 
    Directory Objects. The Graph is a powerful aspect of our platform which will
    enable you to associate objects with each other, or establish membership for
    certain objects to become members of other objects.


    Specific `GET` endpoints will allow you to traverse the JumpCloud Graph to
    return all indirect and directly bound objects in your organization.

    # API Key


    ## Access Your API Key


    To locate your API Key:


    1. Log into the [JumpCloud Admin Console](https://console.jumpcloud.com/).

    2. Go to the username drop down located in the top-right of the Console.

    3. Retrieve your API key from API Settings.


    ## API Key Considerations


    This API key is associated to the currently logged in administrator. Other
    admins will have different API keys.


    **WARNING** Please keep this API key secret, as it grants full access to any
    data accessible via your JumpCloud console account.


    You can also reset your API key in the same location in the JumpCloud Admin
    Console.


    ## Recycling or Resetting Your API Key


    In order to revoke access with the current API key, simply reset your API
    key. This will render all calls using the previous API key inaccessible.


    Your API key will be passed in as a header with the header name "x-api-key".


    ```bash

    curl -H "x-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]"
    "https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/systemgroups"

    ```

    ## Introduction


    JumpCloud System Context Authorization is an alternative way to authenticate
    with a subset of JumpCloud's REST APIs. Using this method, a system can
    manage its information and resource associations, allowing modern auto
    provisioning environments to scale as needed.


    **Notes:**

     * The following documentation applies to Linux Operating Systems only.
     * Systems that have been automatically enrolled using Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP) or systems enrolled using the User Portal install are not eligible to use the System Context API to prevent unauthorized access to system groups and resources. If a script that utilizes the System Context API is invoked on a system enrolled in this way, it will display an error.

    ## Supported Endpoints


    JumpCloud System Context Authorization can be used in conjunction with
    Systems endpoints found in the V1 API and certain System Group endpoints
    found in the v2 API.


    * A system may fetch, alter, and delete metadata about itself, including
    manipulating a system's Group and Systemuser associations,
      * `/api/systems/{system_id}` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systems_get) [`PUT`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systems_put)
    * A system may delete itself from your JumpCloud organization
      * `/api/systems/{system_id}` | [`DELETE`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systems_delete)
    * A system may fetch its direct resource associations under v2 (Groups)
      * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/memberof` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemGroupMembership)
      * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/associations` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemAssociationsList)
      * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/users` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemTraverseUser)
    * A system may alter its direct resource associations under v2 (Groups)
      * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/associations` | [`POST`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemAssociationsPost)
    * A system may alter its System Group associations
      * `/api/v2/systemgroups/{group_id}/members` | [`POST`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemGroupMembersPost)
        * _NOTE_ If a system attempts to alter the system group membership of a different system the request will be rejected

    ## Response Codes


    If endpoints other than those described above are called using the System
    Context API, the server will return a `401` response.


    ## Authentication


    To allow for secure access to our APIs, you must authenticate each API
    request.

    JumpCloud System Context Authorization uses [HTTP
    Signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-00) to
    authenticate API requests.

    The HTTP Signatures sent with each request are similar to the signatures
    used by the Amazon Web Services REST API.

    To help with the request-signing process, we have provided an [example bash
    script](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/shell/SigningExample.sh).
    This example API request simply requests the entire system record. You must
    be root, or have permissions to access the contents of the `/opt/jc`
    directory to generate a signature.


    Here is a breakdown of the example script with explanations.


    First, the script extracts the systemKey from the JSON formatted
    `/opt/jc/jcagent.conf` file.


    ```bash

    #!/bin/bash

    conf="`cat /opt/jc/jcagent.conf`"

    regex="systemKey\":\"(\w+)\""


    if [[ $conf =~ $regex ]] ; then
      systemKey="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    fi

    ```


    Then, the script retrieves the current date in the correct format.


    ```bash

    now=`date -u "+%a, %d %h %Y %H:%M:%S GMT"`;

    ```


    Next, we build a signing string to demonstrate the expected signature
    format. The signed string must consist of the
    [request-line](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-35) and the date
    header, separated by a newline character.


    ```bash

    signstr="GET /api/systems/${systemKey} HTTP/1.1\ndate: ${now}"

    ```


    The next step is to calculate and apply the signature. This is a two-step
    process:


    1. Create a signature from the signing string using the JumpCloud Agent
    private key: ``printf "$signstr" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign
    /opt/jc/client.key``

    2. Then Base64-encode the signature string and trim off the newline
    characters: ``| openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\n'``


    The combined steps above result in:


    ```bash

    signature=`printf "$signstr" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key
    | openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\n'` ;

    ```


    Finally, we make sure the API call sending the signature has the same
    Authorization and Date header values, HTTP method, and URL that were used in
    the signing string.


    ```bash

    curl -iq \
      -H "Accept: application/json" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Date: ${now}" \
      -H "Authorization: Signature keyId=\"system/${systemKey}\",headers=\"request-line date\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",signature=\"${signature}\"" \
      --url https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/systems/${systemKey}
    ```


    ### Input Data


    All PUT and POST methods should use the HTTP Content-Type header with a
    value of 'application/json'. PUT methods are used for updating a record.
    POST methods are used to create a record.


    The following example demonstrates how to update the `displayName` of the
    system.


    ```bash

    signstr="PUT /api/systems/${systemKey} HTTP/1.1\ndate: ${now}"

    signature=`printf "$signstr" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key
    | openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\n'` ;


    curl -iq \
      -d "{\"displayName\" : \"updated-system-name-1\"}" \
      -X "PUT" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Accept: application/json" \
      -H "Date: ${now}" \
      -H "Authorization: Signature keyId=\"system/${systemKey}\",headers=\"request-line date\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",signature=\"${signature}\"" \
      --url https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/systems/${systemKey}
    ```


    ### Output Data


    All results will be formatted as JSON.


    Here is an abbreviated example of response output:


    ```json

    {
      "_id": "625ee96f52e144993e000015",
      "agentServer": "lappy386",
      "agentVersion": "0.9.42",
      "arch": "x86_64",
      "connectionKey": "127.0.0.1_51812",
      "displayName": "ubuntu-1204",
      "firstContact": "2013-10-16T19:30:55.611Z",
      "hostname": "ubuntu-1204"
      ...
    ```


    ## Additional Examples


    ### Signing Authentication Example


    This example demonstrates how to make an authenticated request to fetch the
    JumpCloud record for this system.


    [SigningExample.sh](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/shell/SigningExample.sh)


    ### Shutdown Hook


    This example demonstrates how to make an authenticated request on system
    shutdown.

    Using an init.d script registered at run level 0, you can call the System
    Context API as the system is shutting down.


    [Instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd)
    is an example of an init.d script that only runs at system shutdown.


    After customizing the
    [instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd)
    script, you should install it on the system(s) running the JumpCloud agent.


    1. Copy the modified
    [instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd)
    to `/etc/init.d/instance-shutdown`.

    2. On Ubuntu systems, run `update-rc.d instance-shutdown defaults`. On
    RedHat/CentOS systems, run `chkconfig --add instance-shutdown`.

    # Multi-Tenant Portal Headers


    Multi-Tenant Organization API Headers are available for JumpCloud Admins to
    use when making API requests from Organizations that have multiple managed
    organizations.


    The `x-org-id` is a required header for all multi-tenant admins when making
    API requests to JumpCloud. This header will define to which organization you
    would like to make the request.


    **NOTE** Single Tenant Admins do not need to provide this header when making
    an API request.


    ## Header Value


    `x-org-id`


    ## API Response Codes


    * `400` Malformed ID.

    * `400` x-org-id and Organization path ID do not match.

    * `401` ID not included for multi-tenant admin

    * `403` ID included on unsupported route.

    * `404` Organization ID Not Found.


    ```bash

    curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/directories \
      -H 'accept: application/json' \
      -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
      -H 'x-org-id: {ORG_ID}'

    ```


    ## To Obtain an Individual Organization ID via the UI


    As a prerequisite, your Primary Organization will need to be setup for
    Multi-Tenancy. This provides access to the Multi-Tenant Organization Admin
    Portal.


    1. Log into JumpCloud [Admin Console](https://console.jumpcloud.com). If you
    are a multi-tenant Admin, you will automatically be routed to the
    Multi-Tenant Admin Portal.

    2. From the Multi-Tenant Portal's primary navigation bar, select the
    Organization you'd like to access.

    3. You will automatically be routed to that Organization's Admin Console.

    4. Go to Settings in the sub-tenant's primary navigation.

    5. You can obtain your Organization ID below your Organization's Contact
    Information on the Settings page.


    ## To Obtain All Organization IDs via the API


    * You can make an API request to this endpoint using the API key of your
    Primary Organization.  `https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/organizations/`
    This will return all your managed organizations.


    ```bash

    curl -X GET \
      https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/organizations/ \
      -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}'
    ```

        This endpoint will return all Users Groups bound to an Application,
        either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud
        Graph for your Organization.


        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates  each path from this Application to the
        corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or
        associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group
        from this Application.


        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those
        collections.

        The endpoint allows you to create a bulk job to asynchronously create

        See [Create a System
        User](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systemusers_post)

        for the full list of attributes.


        #### Default User State

        The `state` of each user in the request can be explicitly passed in or

        omitted. If `state` is omitted, then the user will get created

        using the value returned from the

        [Get an
        Organization](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/organizations_get)

        endpoint. The default user state for bulk created users depends on the

        `creation-source` header. For `creation-source:jumpcloud:bulk` the

        default state is stored in
        `settings.newSystemUserStateDefaults.csvImport`.

        For other `creation-source` header values, the default state is stored
        in

        `settings.newSystemUserStateDefaults.applicationImport`


        These default state values can be changed in the admin portal settings

        or by using the

        [Update an
        Organization](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/organization_put)

        endpoint.

        results are also limited

        to 100 items. This endpoint returns a max of 1 event per state per user.
        For example, if a user

        has 3 ACTIVATED events scheduled it will return the next upcoming
        activation event. However, if a

        user also has a SUSPENDED event scheduled along with the ACTIVATED
        events it will return the next

        upcoming activation event _and_ the next upcoming suspension event.

        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes

        corresponding System Group; this array represents all grouping and/or

        This endpoint will return all Users Groups bound to a LDAP Server,
        either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud
        Graph for your Organization.


        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this LDAP server instance to
        the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping and/or
        associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User Group
        from this LDAP server instance.


        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those
        collections.

        This endpoint will return all Users bound to an LDAP Server, either
        directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for
        your Organization.


        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this LDAP server instance to
        the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or
        associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from
        this LDAP server instance.


        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those
        collections.

        This endpoint will return all Systems Groups bound to a Policy, either

        your Organization.


        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this Policy to the
        corresponding System Group; this array represents all grouping and/or

        This endpoint will return all Users Groups bound to a RADIUS Server,
        either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud
        Graph for your Organization.


        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this RADIUS server instance
        to the corresponding User Group; this array represents all grouping
        and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the
        User Group from this RADIUS server instance.


        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those
        collections.

        This endpoint will return all Users bound to a RADIUS Server, either
        directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for
        your Organization.


        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this RADIUS server instance
        to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or
        associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from
        this RADIUS server instance.


        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those
        collections.

        This endpoint will return all Systems Groups bound to a Software App,
        either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud
        Graph for your Organization.


        Each element will contain the group's type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this Software App to the
        corresponding System Group; this array represents all grouping and/or
        associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System
        Group from this Software App.


        See `/associations` endpoint to manage those collections.

        This endpoint will return all Policy Groups bound to a System Group,
        either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud
        Graph for your Organization.


        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this System Group to the
        corresponding Policy Group; this array represents all grouping and/or
        associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the Policy
        Group from this System Group.


        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those
        collections.

        This endpoint will return all RADIUS servers bound to a User Group,
        either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud
        Graph for your Organization.


        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User Group to the
        corresponding RADIUS Server; this array represents all grouping and/or
        associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the RADIUS
        Server from this User Group.


        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those
        collections.

        This endpoint will return all Office 365 Instances bound to a User,
        either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud
        Graph for your Organization.


        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User to the
        corresponding Office 365 instance; this array represents all grouping
        and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the
        Office 365 instance from this User.


        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those
        collections.

        This endpoint will return all System Groups bound to a User, either
        directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for
        your Organization.


        Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.


        The `attributes` object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes
        for all paths followed.


        The `paths` array enumerates each path from this User to the
        corresponding System Group; this array represents all grouping and/or
        associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System
        Group from this User.


        See `/members` and `/associations` endpoints to manage those
        collections.

        You must supply a username and password for `Basic Authentication` that
        is the same as your WorkDay Integrator System User.  Failure to provide
        these credentials  will result in the request being rejected.


        Currently `O-Auth` isn't a supported authentication protocol for
        WorkDay, but will be in the future.


        Currently, only one instance is allowed and it must be `Workday Import`.

            Conditions may be added to an authentication policy using the
            following conditional language:


            ```

            <conditions> ::= <expression>

            <expression> ::= <deviceEncrypted> | <deviceManaged> | <ipAddressIn>
            |
                             <locationIn> | <notExpression> | <allExpression> |
                             <anyExpression>
            <deviceEncrypted> ::= { "deviceEncrypted": <boolean> }

            <deviceManaged> ::= { "deviceManaged": <boolean> }

            <ipAddressIn> ::= { "ipAddressIn": [ <objectId>, ... ] }

            <locationIn> ::= { "locationIn": {
                                 "countries": [
                                   <iso_3166_country_code>, ...
                                 ]
                               }
                             }
            <notExpression> ::= { "not": <expression> }

            <anyExpression> ::= { "any": [ <expression>, ... ] }

            ```


            For example, to add a condition that applies to IP addresses in a
            given list, the following condition can be added:


            ```

            {"ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id> ]}

            ```


            If you would rather exclude IP addresses in the given lists, the
            following condition could be added:


            ```

            {
              "not": {
                "ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id_1>, <ip_list_object_id_2> ]
              }
            }

            ```


            You may also include more than one condition and choose whether
            "all" or "any" of them must be met for the policy to apply:


            ```

            {
              "all": [
                {
                  "ipAddressIn": [ <ip_list_object_id>, ... ]
                },
                {
                  "deviceManaged": true
                },
                {
                  "locationIn": {
                    countries: [ <iso_3166_country_code>, ... ]
                  }
                }

    google.protobuf.Any:
      description: >-
        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
        with a

        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }

        Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

        Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
             if err != nil {
               ...
             }
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

        name "y.z".



        JSON


        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"
            }
      additionalProperties: {}
      properties:
        '@type':
          description: >-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
            serialized

            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical
            form

            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that
            they

            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
            the

            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
            type

            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

            type.googleapis.com.


            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

            used with implementation specific semantics.
