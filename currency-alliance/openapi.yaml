    # Introduction


    The Currency Alliance API facilitates various use cases for Loyalty
    Commerce. Our API allows our Partners to:
     - Manage Loyalty Currencies in the Cloud
     - Access Popular Loyalty Currencies from other Brands
     - Sell and Distribute your Loyalty Currency to Partners
     - Issue, Transfer, Redeem, or Exchange any loyalty currency via API
     - Pull Transaction History Details into 3rd Party Platforms
     - Enable the Exchange of Loyalty Currencies into Gift Cards and other Redemption Products in many fiat currencies
    To benefit from the Currency Alliance platform, you do not need to use all
    of these features. While there are many Endpoints for specific use cases,
    most Partners end up using only a few Endpoints.


    # Architecture

    The Currency Alliance API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable
    resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns
    JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes,
    authentication, and verbs.


    Calls to the API have to be properly authenticated using your public and
    secret API keys. The keys are available in the 'CREDENTIALS' section of the
    "Loyalty API" module in the Management Dashboard. These keys MUST never be
    exposed to the public or any unauthorized person.


    The API is designed for a server to server communication. If you want to
    communicate with the API from a client it must be through a server
    environment, to protect the integrity of the requests and the API keys, and
    not expose them on front-end platforms.


    # Authentication

    The API authenticates every request based on two elements - Credential and
    Signature. Every request must include an `Authorization` header with the
    following two elements.

    `Credential=<public-key>, Signature=<calculated-signature>`


    ## Credential

    In this parameter, the API requires you to provide the `<public-key>` that
    is unique to your account. Your keys are available in the 'CREDENTIALS'
    section of the "Loyalty API" module in the Management Dashboard.


    ## Signature

    ### How is the Signature calculated?
      The signature is a [HMAC-SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) hash in hexadecimal of the request content, using the `private_key` as the key.
      Keep in mind that the string you use to generate the signature and the string you send to the API has to be exactly the same. This includes newlines and spaces. If you compress the JSON body of your request, after generating the signature, the request will be rejected.

    ### POST/PUT/PATCH HTTP methods
      These types of requests use the string representation of the body to calculate the signature.

      For example, for the request with body: `{"foo": "bar"}` the signature calculated using `sec_12345` as the private key would be `4d84ba663b9c6179dd98023087da5baa8a4e3eb59ba45284935261350ba70742`

    ### GET HTTP method
      This type of request uses the query string to calculate the signature. Take into account that the "?" character must not be included while calculating the signature.

      For example, for the request with query string: `?foo=bar` the signature calculated using `sec_12345` as the private key would be `88d64dfcb542c35dc22bae059bd5f5a5d038572a7b391dfc4cd5f3a5530c1760` which is the hash for the string "foo=bar"

      To generate the signature of a GET request without any parameters, simply encode an empty string.

    # Security

    The API uses asymmetric cryptography to authenticate requests using the API
    keys we provide. This provides the following assurances:
      - **Requester identification:** Every request requires your public key to be sent, in conjunction with a signature generated with your secret key.
      - **Protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** The request signature is calculated using the body of the request, which means that any request that has been tampered with during the transport will be rejected by the Currency Alliance platform, since the signature received will not match the request contents.

    The API only supports requests over HTTPS.


    # Idempotency

    The API supports [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)
    requests to safely retry requests without having to worry about doing the
    same operation more than once.

    For example, if there's a connection error generating a gift card, you can
    retry the request with the same idempotency key without having to worry
    about creating multiple gift cards.


    To send an idempotent request, include an additional `Idempotency-Key:
    <key>` header in the request. An Idempotency Key `<key>` is a unique
    identifier generated by the client with a length between 1 and 255
    characters. While this can be any type of unique key, we recommend a UUID to
    avoid collisions. An Idempotency key expires 8 hours after the initial
    request.


    In a repeated request the response will always have the response body of the
    original request, along with the same status and `400` errors, if any. The
    response will also include the header `Idempotency-Repeated: true`. In the
    rare instances where a request is repeated while the first one has not been
    completed yet, the API will respond with a `409 - Conflict` status.


    The API supports idempotency on POST and PATCH requests. Since GET, PUT and
    DELETE are idempotent by default, the `Idempotency-Key` header will be
    ignored.



    # Key fields

    Currency Alliance acts as a connectivity bridge between various partners
    using its standardized APIs and interface, hence, shielding each partner
    from the complexity, nuances, and customizations of hundreds of loyalty
    systems and merchant partners. However, the interacting partners need to
    have a common reference for a transaction in their own system for easy
    reconciliation as well as for customer support purposes.

    In this section, you will find information on some key fields and attributes
    that are used through our API and on different objects. This information
    will help you understand how to use these key fields.


    ## External Reference

    The field `external_reference` is used for each transaction request to
    provide a unique identifier from your system that can be used as a reference
    during the reconciliation process. This could be a GUID, internal
    transaction identifier, invoice number, booking number, itinerary number, or
    any other unique number in your system that can be used to uniquely identify
    the action. Even though this is not a required field, it is strongly
    recommended that you provide value in this field.


    ## Loyalty System Id

    The field `loyalty_system_id` is returned by our system on each transaction
    and it provides the unique identifier in the partner loyalty system. This ID
    is not generated by Currency Alliance but is provided by the partner loyalty
    program and hence could be used as a common field for reconciliation between
    your system and the partner's system.


    ## Loyalty System Data

    Sometimes, a loyalty program requires you to send some additional data to
    connect. For example, user_id, application_id, partner_code, etc. You will
    be able to provide the data in this field for all the transactions with the
    partner loyalty program. To check if and what additional data is required by
    the partner loyalty program, refer to the Partners Endpoint.



    # Common Use cases

    Our API can be used for numerous Loyalty Commerce use cases. Some of the
    most common use cases are mentioned below along with the information on
    which Endpoints to use for each use case. There are auxiliary Endpoints that
    could be used to enhance your integration and customer experience. For
    example, you could pull all transaction history out via the API into your
    Business Intelligence or data staging environments or you could validate the
    member details before issuing Loyalty Currency Units.


    ## Accrual/Issue/Top-up

    The underlying objective of this use case is to “give Loyalty Currency Units
    to a member” for one reason or another. The reason could be a purchase of a
    product, their birthday, completion of a survey, referral, customer service
    issue, etc. Furthermore, you may want to give the member units of your own
    Loyalty Currency or one of your Partners’ Loyalty Currency.


    You should use Accruals Endpoints for this use case. There are three
    Endpoints that can be used for issuing your or a Partner’s currency. You can
    use any one of the Endpoints or a combination of them to issue Loyalty
    Currency Units to the member.


    ### Direct Accruals

    This Endpoint is to be used when you know the exact number of Loyalty
    Currency Units to give to a member. In this scenario, you are calculating
    the number of Loyalty Currency Units in your environment and providing the
    exact number of units in the endpoint.


    ### Purchase Rules

    This Endpoint is to be used when you would like to give the number of
    Loyalty Currency Units based on Purchase Rule(s) defined in the Currency
    Alliance system. For example, giving points worth 1% of the fiat transaction
    amount. In this case, your application does not need to know how to
    calculate the number of Loyalty Currency Units or even the cost of the
    Loyalty Currency Units in any of your Partners' programs.


    ### Activity Rules

    This Endpoint is to be used when you would like to issue the number of
    Loyalty Currency Units based on pre-defined Activity Rule(s) in the system.
    For example, you might offer 200 points for posting a product review or
    referring a friend.


    ## Currency Exchange

    Our API provides tools for quick collaboration among brands to enable their
    respective members to exchange loyalty units between programs. The exchange
    could be one-way only, or both directions – in and out – of the programs.
    Use the Loyalty Currency Exchange Endpoints to implement this use case.
    There are 2 Endpoints that can be used to enable exchange between partners.


    ### Simulate an exchange

    This Endpoint allows you to simulate how many Loyalty Currency units the
    member would receive of a Partner’s Loyalty Currency in exchange. This can
    be used to show the member how many points in one or more programs they
    could get if completing the exchange.


    ### Execute an exchange

    This Endpoint allows you to comlete the exchange Loyalty Currency units to
    the Partner’s Loyalty Currency.


    **Tip:** You could use the Partners Endpoints to get the list of Exchange
    Partners and automatically display the fields required for each program to
    complete the exchange. This will be necessary for loyalty programs that
    require more member validation fields than just the membership number.


    ## Redemption/Pay with Points

    Our Redemption Endpoints have standardized the redemption process across
    various types of loyalty programs and underlying loyalty systems. This
    shields you from needing to understand the underlying complexity to
    integrate into a new loyalty system or modifying the existing integration
    for a different set of parameters for a new partner.


    You should use Standard Redemption Endpoints for this use case. There are
    four Endpoints that can be used for allowing a Partner’s Loyalty Currency as
    a form of payment. You can use any one of the Endpoints or a combination of
    them depending on your customer journey. Although not necessary, we highly
    recommend you use the  “Lookup a Member” Endpoint to validate if the member
    exists and if they have enough balance to complete the payment before
    submitting the payment transaction.


    Strictly speaking, Loyalty Exchange and Exchange for Gift Cards are also
    redemptions, but we provide explicit Endpoints for those actions due to the
    very high occurrence of those use cases in the industry. Standard
    Redemptions refers to any other redemptions where the Partners have allowed
    the member to redeem (exchange) their Loyalty Currency Units for your
    Products and Services. The products and services may range from flower
    delivery to booking a trip, buying an insurance plan, topping up their
    mobile plan, paying at a restaurant, buying concert tickets, or even
    applying points toward the purchase of a car.


    ### Simulate a Redemption

    To simulate the redemption action and provide information to the member such
    as the number of points required to complete the action, cancellation
    allowed, etc. without actually deducting the points from their balance or
    completing the transaction.


    ### Execute a Redemption

    Deduct points from the member’s account in exchange for the product or
    service offered.


    ### Adjust a Redemption

    If allowed by the Partner, you may use this Endpoint to notify of any
    modification in an already completed Redemption. The system will
    automatically identify if more points are to be redeemed or points are to be
    refunded to the member.


    ### Cancel a Redemption

    If allowed by the Partner, you may use this Endpoint to cancel an already
    completed Redemption to refund the points.

      These Endpoints are used for redemption via Gift cards. These Endpoints
      could be used to retrieve a particular Gift Card, to retrieve a list of
      enabled Gift cards, to simulate an exchange of currency units for  a Gift
      card, to exchange currency units for a Gift card, or to redeem a custom
      Gift card. The gift card exchange feature for the loyalty currency must be
      enabled in the following section of the Management Dashboard:
        *Redemptions > Gift Card Management*

      There are two objects in the system that represent a Gift card - GiftCard
      Object and GiftCardCode Object. GiftCard Object represents the general
      characteristics of the Gift card whereas GiftCardCode Object represents
      the characteristics that are specific to the Gift card issued to a member.


      For example, if a currency owner enables Starbucks gift card through the
      Management Dashboard there will be a GiftCard Object in our system that
      would represent general details of Starbucks cards including the possible
      denominations of let's say $5, $10, $15, $25. When a member exchanges
      their points for a Starbucks gift card, the system will create a
      GiftCardCode object specific for that member with specific information
      such as the value of the Gift card ($5).


      ## The Gift Card object

      GiftCard Object represents a Gift card that could be used for redemption
      of Loyalty Currency units via Gift cards. It contains the details of the
      general characteristics of the Gift card. Note that it doesn't represent
      an issues/redeemed Gift card but only the general characteristics. Once a
      Gift card is issued GiftCardCode Object provides the details specific to
      the Gift card for the member. It has the following attributes:

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/GiftCard"
      showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />


      ## The Gift Card Code object

      GiftCardCode Object represents the code details for the issued Gift card.
      It contains information specific to the Gift card issued to the member.
      For example, in general, Starbucks Gift cards could be of any one of
      denominations of $5, $10, $25, $50. This Object will provide the exact
      amount of the Gift card that was issued to the user. It has the following
      attributes:

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/GiftCardCode"
      showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />
    name: Gift cards
  - description: >
      Partners Endpoints are used to retrieve information about Partners and
      specific Partnerships with those Partners. These Endpoints provide
      information such as Company Name, Logos, Loyalty Currency Information, the
      terms of the partnership(s), actions available, and the required fields
      for the actions available. This information can be used to drive different
      UX paths and to automate API calls.
    name: Partners
  - description: >
      All actions in the system that result in the movement of any Loyalty
      Currency are represented by a unique Transaction object. E.g. some of the
      actions are:

      - Creation of Loyalty Currency units

      - Purchase of partner's Loyalty Currency units

      - Issuance or transfer of Loyalty Currency to a member, partner, or other
      accounts

      - Exchange of Loyalty Currency units to another Loyalty Currency

      - Redemption of Loyalty Currency units to gift cards or other products


      Transaction Endpoints can be used to create a transaction, retrieve
      information of a transaction, all transactions of a member, or all
      transactions related to your account. These Endpoints can also be used to
      cancel or update a transaction.


      NOTE: Create a Transaction CANNOT be used to do accruals and redemptions,
      including Gift Cards and Currency Exchange. Use Accruals and Redemptions
      Endpoints for such actions; the system will automatically create the
      underlying required transaction.


      ## The Transaction object

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Transaction"
      showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />
    name: Transactions
  - description: >
      The Purchase Endpoints allows you to simulate or execute a purchase rule
      to issue loyalty currency units to your members. The purchase loyalty
      rules can be defined in the following section in the Management Dashboard:


      Loyalty Rules > Purchase Rules
    name: Purchase rules
  - description: >
      Redemptions are referred to as any action that allows the members to
      redeem the value of their Loyalty Currency Units in exchange for any
      product, services, or any other redemption options. Standard Redemption
      Endpoints provides a standardized way for you to allow members to redeem
      their Loyalty Currency Units for any type of product or service that is
      not a Gift Card or an Exchange into another loyalty program’s Loyalty
      Currency.


      Standard Redemptions are any redemptions where the Partners have allowed
      the member to redeem (exchange) their Loyalty Currency Units for your
      Products and Services. The products and services may range from flower
      delivery to booking a trip, buying an insurance plan, topping up their
      mobile plan, paying at a restaurant, buying concert tickets, or even
      applying points toward the purchase of a car.


      The Partners define in the Partnership Settings that the members can
      redeem their points in various product and service categories. Thus, it is
      very important that you provide information about the product and services
      in the request message. If you don’t have defined product categories and
      details, simply send “General” in the 'category' field.


      Some Partners may allow an option to cancel or modify the redemption. This
      information is provided in the response messages of the Endpoints for you
      to inform the member before completing the redemption.
    name: Standard redemptions
    x-displayName: Standard
  - description: >
      The Exchange Endpoints enables you to allow your members to exchange their
      Loyalty Currency Units with your partners' Loyalty Currency Units. You can
      have a different Exchange Partnership with each Exchange Partner, where
      you could allow exchange IN or OUT of your currency. The exchange price
      and other settings are established during the Exchange Partnership set up
      in the Management Dashboard.


      Note that the currencies to be exchanged could be present in different
      regions and fiat currencies. Currency Alliance will do the currency
      conversion for the fiat currencies based on the mid-day exchange rate
      between the fiat currencies.
    name: Exchanges
  - name: Cohorts
  - name: Cohort Purchases
  - name: Cohort Activities
  - description: >
      Member Endpoints can be used to create a new member, look up information
      on a member, retrieve a member's details to your system, or update any
      member's details. Only the Currency Owner i.e. the loyalty program to
      which the member belongs has access to create a member or update a member.


      The Partners could look up a member to confirm if the member exists, check
      the member account balance, or other details of the member record based on
      permissions granted by the Currency Owner.


      Currency Alliance has standardized these Endpoints and orchestrates the
      calls to various Loyalty programs to validate a member, get member
      details, etc. if the Currency Alliance platform is not the primary data
      store for the relevant loyalty program.


      ## The Member object

      The Member Object represents a member record. For the loyalty programs
      where Currency Alliance is not the primary data store for their members,
      the system will connect with the loyalty program system to fetch the
      member information and present it in the following format.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Member"
      showReadOnly={true} showWriteOnly={true} />
    name: Members

      The Activities Endpoints allows you to simulate or execute an activity
      rule to issue loyalty currency units to your members. The activity loyalty
      rules can be defined in the following section in the Management Dashboard:


      Loyalty Rules > Activity Rules
    name: Activity rules
  - description: >
      Direct Accruals Endpoint is to be used in the scenarios where you know in

        many units of the Loyalty Currency will be given for a corresponding
        action. For example, if user buys a particular item then how many
        Currency units will be issued. This does not result in issuance of
        Currency units or execution of a transaction in the system, it is only a

        booking, this endpoint would retrigger the purchase rules based on the

        This Endpoint is typically used in scenarios where you'd want to show to
        your member that how many units of other currency they would get in
        exchange for your Loyalty Currency Units or vice versa. For example, if
        you allow a user to select the number of units of your Loyalty Currency
        to exchange with your partner's Loyalty Currency, you can use this
        Endpoint to dynamically show how many units of your partner's Loyalty
        Currency will be provided to the user for the selected number.


        You can send a specific Loyalty Currency as a destination to identify
        the number of units of that specific Loyalty Currency. Or you could send
        the destination Loyalty Currency as null and the system will return the
        array with the exchange result for all the Exchange Partners’ Loyalty
        Currencies.


        Note that the member information is not mandatory but is highly
        recommended to be input as the exchange price/cost might be dependent on
        the member attributes.

        economic value to a member, but they don´t know how many units of a
        destination currency can be obtained for that amount of fiat currency. 
        For example, if a partner wants to give 2.43€ worth of value, they can
        submit that amount via this Endpoint with the desired destination
        currency and obtain the maximum number of units in that destination
        currency that can be obtained with 2.43€

        This Endpoint is used in scenarios where one might want to simulate the
        redemption of Loyalty Currency Units for a product or a service without
        actually completing the transaction. This can be used to show a member
        how much it would cost in points for the products or services. For
        example, if a member would like to redeem points for a hotel booking,
        cab ride, shoe purchase, spa treatment, or any other product/service,
        this Endpoint would be used to calculate how many Loyalty Currency Units
        would be required as a form of payment for the product/service.


        You can send a list of products and services along with the amount or
        the price to identify the Loyalty Currency Units required to be redeemed
        for each type of product or service. The amount, or the price, can be
        provided either in units in the field "loyalty_amount" or in fiat
        currency in the field "fiat_amount". It is highly advisable to send the
        information as well as the member information as the redemption value
        per Loyalty Currency Unit may depend on any of these factors. For
        example, a Gold member may require a fewer number of Loyalty Currency
        Units than a Bronze member to redeem in exchange for a hotel booking
        whereas booking a cab ride may not depend on the member tier.


        The response will contain the total amount in fiat currency and total
        number of Loyalty Currency Units required for this redemption. If the
        member information is sent then the response will also provide
        additional information such as their available balance in Loyalty
        Currency Units and fiat value of those Loyalty Currency Units for
        General product if the member does not have sufficient balance to
        complete this redemption. Additional information in the response would
        be whether the Currency Owner allows adjustments and cancellations of
        Redemptions or not.

        It is mandatory to provide the information regarding the product or the

            Textual description for why the transaction was created. This text
            is presented to the origin and destination account holders in their
            transaction history. While any string length is accepted, 26
            characters or less is typically optimal to explain to the member in
            their transaction history why this transaction was created.

          description: >-
            Future date on which the Loyalty Currency Units should be made
            available to the member. The Loyalty Currency Units would be
            reserved for the member but not made available till the release date
            is reached. This is used in scenarios such as hotel bookings or
            flight purchases that are done before the trip so that the member
            doesn’t redeem the points until they’ve actually stayed at the hotel
            or flown in the booked flight. The transaction will be created with
            the status as "pending" and it can be updated or cancelled until the
            release date. Values with seconds are accepted but will be truncated
            to the minute. Refer Transaction Object for further details.
