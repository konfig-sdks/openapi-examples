      The task is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are
      centered. In the Asana application, multiple tasks populate the middle
      pane according to some view parameters, and the set of selected tasks
      determines the more detailed information presented in the details pane.


      Sections are unique in that they will be included in the `memberships`
      field of task objects returned in the API when the task is within a
      section. They can also be used to manipulate the ordering of a task within
      a project.


      [Queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) return a [compact
      representation of each task object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com). To
      retrieve *all* fields or *specific set* of the fields, use [field
      selectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) to manipulate what data is
      included in a response.
    name: Tasks
  - description: >-
      A project represents a prioritized list of tasks in Asana or a board with
      columns of tasks represented as cards. A project exists in a single
      workspace or organization and is accessible to a subset of users in that
      workspace or organization, depending on its permissions.


      Projects in organizations are shared with a single team. Currently, the
      team of a project cannot be changed via the API. Non-organization
      workspaces do not have teams and so you should not specify the team of
      project in a regular workspace.


      Followers of a project are a subset of the members of that project.
      Followers of a project will receive all updates including tasks created,
      added and removed from that project. Members of the project have access to
      and will receive status updates of the project. Adding followers to a
      project will add them as members if they are not already, removing
      followers from a project will not affect membership.


      **Note:** You can use certain project endpoints to operate on [user task
      lists](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) ([My
      Tasks](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/my-tasks)) by
      substituting the `{project_gid}` with the `{user_task_list_gid}`. For
      example, you can perform operations on the custom fields of a user task
      list by using the following projects endpoints: [Add a custom field to a
      project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com), [Remove a custom field from a
      project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) and [Get a project's custom

      [status update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).

      Portfolios have some restrictions on size. Each portfolio has a max of 500
      items and, like projects, a maximum of 20 custom fields.

      _Note: Custom fields are a premium feature. Integrations which work with
      custom fields need to handle an assortment of use cases for free and
      premium users in context of free and premium organizations. For a detailed
      examination of which data users will have access in different
      circumstances, review the section below on access control._


      In the Asana application, tasks, projects, and portfolios can hold
      user-specified [custom
      fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields) which provide
      extra information (e.g., a "priority" property with an associated value,
      or a number representing the time required to complete a task). This lets
      a user define the type of information that each item within a project or
      portfolio can contain in addition to the built-in fields that Asana
      provides.

      `display_value` is a read-only field that will always be a string. For
      apps that use custom fields, this is a great way to safely display/export
      the value of a custom field, regardless of its type. We suggest apps use
      this field in order to future-proof for changes to custom fields.


      #### Characteristics of custom fields


      * There is metadata that defines the custom field. This metadata can be
      shared across an entire workspace, or be specific to a project or
      portfolio.

      * Creating a custom field setting on a project or portfolio means each
      direct child will have the custom field. This is conceptually akin to
      adding columns in a database or a spreadsheet: every task (row) in the
      project (table) can contain information for that field, including "blank"
      values (i.e., `null` data). For portfolio custom fields, every project
      (row) in the portfolio (table) will contain information for the custom
      field.

      * Custom field settings only go one child deep. This means that a custom
      field setting on a portfolio will give each project the custom field, but
      not each task within those projects.

      * Tasks have custom field _values_ assigned to them.


      #### Types of custom fields


      Integrations using custom fields need to be aware of the six basic types
      that a custom field can adopt. These types are:


      * `text` - an arbitrary, relatively short string of text

      * `number` - a number with a defined level of precision

      * `enum` - a selection of a single option from a defined list of options
      (i.e., mutually exclusive selections)

      * `multi_enum` - a selection of one or more options from a defined list of
      options (i.e., mutually inclusive selections)

      * `date` - a reference date with an optional time value

      * `people` - a list of active contributors (i.e., where their relationship
      to the work is defined in the custom field title)


      #### Example use case


      Consider an organization that has defined a custom field for "Priority".
      This field is of `enum` type and can have user-defined values of `Low`,
      `Medium`, or `High`. This is the field metadata, and it is visible within,
      and shared across, the entire organization.


      A project is then created in the organization, called "Bugs", and the
      "Priority" custom field is associated with that project. This will allow
      all tasks within the "Bugs" project to have an associated "Priority".


      A new task is created within "Bugs". This task, then, has a field named
      "Priority" which can take on the custom field value of one of `[null]`,
      `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.


      #### Custom fields in the API


      These custom fields are accessible via the API through a number of
      endpoints at the top level (e.g. `/custom_fields` and
      `/custom_field_settings`) and through requests on workspaces, portfolios,
      projects, and tasks resources. The API also provides a way to fetch both
      the metadata and data which define each particular custom field, so that a
      client application may render proper UI to display or edit the values.


      Text fields are currently limited to 1024 characters. On tasks, their
      custom field value will have a `text_value` property to represent this
      field.


      Number fields can have an arbitrary `precision` associated with them; for
      example, a precision of `2` would round its value to the second
      (hundredths) place (e.g., `1.2345` would round to `1.23`). On tasks, the
      custom field value will have a `number_value` property to represent this
      field.


      #### Enum fields


      Enum fields represent a selection from a list of options. On the metadata,
      they will contain all of the options in an array. Each option has 4
      properties:


      * `gid` - the GID of this enum option. Note that this is the GID of the
      individual _option_. The custom field itself has a separate `gid`.

      * `name` - the name of the option (e.g., "Choice #1")

      * `enabled` - whether this field is enabled. Disabled fields are not
      available to choose from when disabled, and are visually hidden in the
      Asana application, but they remain in the metadata for custom field values
      which were set to the option before the option was disabled.

      * `color` - a color associated with this choice.


      On the task's custom field value, the enum will have an `enum_value`
      property which will be the same as one of the choices from the list
      defined in the custom field metadata.


      #### Querying an organization for its custom fields


      For custom fields shared across the workspace or organization, the
      workspace [can be queried](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) for its list
      of defined custom fields. Like other collection queries, the fields will
      be returned as a compact record; slightly different from most other
      compact records is the fact that the compact record for custom fields
      includes `type` as well as `gid` and `name`.


      #### Accessing custom field definitions


      The [custom fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) reference describes
      how the metadata which defines a custom field is accessed. A GET request
      with a `gid` can be issued on the `/custom_fields` endpoint to fetch the
      full definition of a single custom field given its `gid` from (for
      instance) listing all custom fields on a workspace, or getting the `gid`
      from a custom field settings object or a task.


      #### Associating custom fields with a project or portfolio


      A mapping between a custom field and a project or portfolio is handled
      with a [custom field settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) object.
      This object contains a reference for each of the custom fields and the
      project or portfolio, as well as additional information about the status
      of that particular custom field (e.g., `is_important`, which defines
      whether or not the custom field will appear in the list/grid on the Asana
      application).


      #### Accessing custom field values on tasks or projects


      The [tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) reference has information
      on how custom fields look on tasks. custom fields will return as an array
      on the property `custom_fields`, and each entry will contain,
      side-by-side, the compact representation of the custom field metadata and
      a `{typename}_value` property that stores the value set for the custom
      field.


      Of particular note is that the top-level `gid` of each entry in the
      `custom_fields` array is the `gid` of the custom field metadata, as it is
      the compact representation of this metadata. This can be used to refer to
      the full metadata by making a request to the
      `/custom_fields/{custom_fields_id}` endpoint as described above.


      Custom fields can be set just as in the Asana-defined fields on a task via
      `POST` or `PUT` requests. You can see an example in the [update a
      task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) endpoint.


      Custom fields on projects follow this same pattern.


      #### Warning: Program defensively with regards to custom field definitions


      Asana application users have the ability to change the definitions of
      custom field metadata. This means that as you write scripts or
      applications to work with them, it is possible for the definitions to
      change at any time, which may cause an application using them to break or
      malfunction if it makes assumptions about the metadata for a particular
      custom field. When using custom fields, it is a good idea to program
      *defensively*, meaning you your application should double-check that the
      custom field metadata are what it expects.


      Storing the state of the custom field metadata for too long if you
      dynamically create a model for it can cause your model to become out of
      sync with the model stored in Asana. For example, if you encounter an
      `enum` value on a task that does not match any option in your metadata
      model, your metadata model has become out of date with the custom field
      metadata.


      #### Enabled and disabled values


      When information that is contained in a custom field value loses a logical
      association with its metadata definition, the value becomes disabled. This
      can happen in a couple of simple ways, for example, if you remove the
      custom field metadata from a project, or move a task with a custom field
      to a different project which does not have the custom field metadata
      associated with it. The value remains on the task, and the custom field
      metadata can still be found and examined, but as the context in which the
      custom field makes sense is gone, the custom field cannot change its
      value; it can only be cleared.


      _Note: Tasks that are associated with multiple projects do not become
      disabled, so long as at least one of the projects is still associated with
      the custom field metadata. In other words, tasks with multiple projects
      will retain logically associated to the set of custom field metadata
      represented by all of their projects._


      Moving the task back under a project with that custom field applied to it
      or applying the custom field metadata to the current project will return
      the custom field value to an enabled state. In this scenario, the custom
      field will be re-enabled and editable again.


      In the Asana application, disabled fields are grayed out and not allowed
      to change, other than to be discarded. In the API, we return a property
      `enabled: false` to inform the external application that the value has
      been disabled.


      Note that the API enforces the same operations on disabled custom field
      values as hold in the Asana application: they may not have their values
      changed, since the lack of context for the values of a custom field in
      general doesn't provide enough information to know what new values should
      be. Setting the custom field value to `null` will clear and remove the
      custom field value from the task.


      #### Custom field access control


      Custom fields are a complex feature of the Asana platform, and their
      access in the Asana application and in the API vary based on the status of
      the user and project. When building your application, it is best to be
      defensive and not assume the given user will have read or write access to
      a custom field, and fail gracefully when this occurs.

      A tag is a label that can be attached to any task in Asana. It exists in a
      single workspace or organization.


      Tags have some metadata associated with them, but it is possible that we

      Asana's audit log is an immutable log of [important
      events](/docs/audit-log-events#supported-audit-log-events) in your
      organization's Asana instance.


      The audit log API allows you to monitor and act upon important security
      and compliance-related changes. Organizations might use this API endpoint
      to:


      * Set up proactive alerting with a Security Information and Event
      Management (SIEM) tool like
      [Splunk](https://asana.com/guide/help/api/splunk)

      * Conduct reactive investigations when a security incident takes place

      * Visualize key domain data in aggregate to identify security trends


      Note that since the API provides insight into what is happening in an
      Asana instance, the data is
      [read-only](https://raw.githubusercontent.com). That is, there are no
      "write" or "update" endpoints for audit log events.


      Only [Service
      Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts) in
      [Enterprise Domains](https://asana.com/enterprise) can access audit log
      API endpoints. Authentication with a Service Account's [personal access
      token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) is required.


      For a full list of supported events, see [supported
      AuditLogEvents](/docs/audit-log-events#supported-audit-log-events).

      There are many cases where you want to accomplish a variety of work in the
      Asana API but want to minimize the number of HTTP requests you make. For
      example:


      * Modern browsers limit the number of requests that a single web page can
        make at once.
      * Mobile apps will use more battery life to keep the cellular radio on
        when making a series of requests.
      * There is an overhead cost to developing software that can make multiple
        requests in parallel.
      * Some cloud platforms handle parallelism poorly, or disallow it
        entirely.


      To make development easier in these use cases, Asana provides a **batch
      API** that enables developers to perform multiple “actions” by making only
      a single HTTP request.


      #### Making a batch request


      To make a batch request, send a `POST` request to `/batch`. Like other
      `POST` endpoints, the body should contain a `data` envelope. Inside this
      envelope should be a single `actions` field, containing a list of “action”
      objects.  Each action represents a standard request to an existing
      endpoint in the Asana API.


      **The maximum number of actions allowed in a single batch request is 10**.
      Making a batch request with no actions in it will result in a `400 Bad
      Request`.


      When the batch API receives the list of actions to execute, it will
      dispatch those actions to the already-implemented endpoints specified by
      the `relative_path` and `method` for each action. This happens in
      parallel, so all actions in the request will be processed simultaneously.
      There is no guarantee of the execution order for these actions, nor is
      there a way to use the output of one action as the input of another action
      (such as creating a task and then commenting on it).


      The response to the batch request will contain (within the `data`
      envelope) a list of result objects, one for each action. The results are
      guaranteed to be in the same order as the actions in the request (e.g.,
      the first result in the response corresponds to the first action in the
      request)


      The batch API will always attempt to return a `200 Success` response with
      individual result objects for each individual action in the request. Only
      in certain cases (such as missing authorization or malformed JSON in the
      body) will the entire request fail with another status code. Even if every
      individual action in the request fails, the batch API will still return a
      `200 Success` response, and each result object in the response will
      contain the errors encountered with each action.


      #### Rate limiting


      The batch API fully respects all of our rate limiting. This means that a
      batch request counts against *both* the standard rate limiter and the
      concurrent request limiter as though you had made a separate HTTP request
      for every individual action. For example, a batch request with five
      actions counts as five separate requests in the standard rate limiter, and
      counts as five concurrent requests in the concurrent request limiter. The
      batch request itself incurs no cost.


      If any of the actions in a batch request would exceed any of the enforced
      limits, the *entire* request will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests`
      error. This is to prevent the unpredictability of which actions might
      succeed if not all of them could succeed.


      #### Restrictions


      Not every endpoint can be accessed through the batch API. Specifically,
      the following actions cannot be taken and will result in a `400 Bad
      Request` for that action:


      * Uploading attachments

      * Creating, getting, or deleting organization exports

      * Any SCIM operations

      * Nested calls to the batch API

      An event is an object representing a change to a resource that was
      observed by an event subscription. Event streams rely on the same
      infrastructure as webhooks, which ensures events are delivered within a
      minute (on average). This system is designed for at most once delivery,
      meaning in exceptional circumstances a small number of events may be
      missing from the stream. For this reason, if your use case requires strong
      guarantees about processing all changes on a resource and cannot tolerate
      any missing events, regardless of how rare that might be, we recommend
      building a fallback polling system that fetches the resource periodically
      as well. Note that while webhooks cannot be replayed once delivered,
      events are retrievable from the event stream for 24 hours after being
      processed.


      In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to
      higher rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally,
      change events "bubble up" (e.g., listening to events on a project would
      include when stories are added to tasks in the project, and even to
      subtasks).


      Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token.
      The response will be a `412 Precondition Failed` error - the same as if
      the sync token had expired.


      Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the
      immediately preceding call.


      Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go "backward" in the
      history by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current
      sync token is generally safe, and will always return the same results.


      When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the sync
      token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a set of
      data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.


      Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner, depending
      on load on the service.

      Jobs represent processes that handle asynchronous work. A job created when
      an endpoint requests an action that will be handled asynchronously, such
      as project or task duplication.


      Only the creator of the duplication process can access the duplication
      status of the new object.


      *Note*: With any work that is handled asynchronously (e.g., [project
      instantation from a template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com),
      duplicating a [task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) or
      [project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com), etc.), the *intermittent
      states* of newly-created objects may not be consistent. That is, object
      properties may return different values each time when polled until the job
      `status` has returned a `succeeded` value.

        There are three possible `parent` values for this request: `project`,
        `project_brief`, and `task`. For a project, an attachment refers to a
        file uploaded to the "Key resources" section in the project Overview.
        For a project brief, an attachment refers to inline files in the project
        brief itself. For a task, an attachment refers to a file directly
        associated to that task.


        Note that within the Asana app, inline images in the task description do
        not appear in the index of image thumbnails nor as stories in the task.
        However, requests made to `GET /attachments` for a task will return all
        of the images in the task, including inline images.

      description: >-
        Upload an attachment.


        This method uploads an attachment on an object and returns the compact

        record for the created attachment object. This is possible by either:


        - Providing the URL of the external resource being attached, or

        - Downloading the file content first and then uploading it as any other
        attachment. Note that it is not possible to attach

        files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box, Vimeo & Google
        Drive via the API


        The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this
        endpoint.


        This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing
        the full contents of the file to be uploaded.


        Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line

        terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\r\n` outlined

        [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules)
        in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

      summary: Get audit log events
      operationId: AuditLogApi_getAuditLogEvents
      description: >-
        Retrieve the audit log events that have been captured in your domain.


        This endpoint will return a list of
        [AuditLogEvent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) objects, sorted by
        creation time in ascending order. Note that the Audit Log API captures
        events from October 8th, 2021 and later. Queries for events before this
        date will not return results.


        There are a number of query parameters (below) that can be used to
        filter the set of [AuditLogEvent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com)
        objects that are returned in the response. Any combination of query
        parameters is valid. When no filters are provided, all of the events
        that have been captured in your domain will match.


        The list of events will always be
        [paginated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com). The default limit is
        1000 events. The next set of events can be retrieved using the `offset`
        from the previous response. If there are no events that match the
        provided filters in your domain, the endpoint will return `null` for the
        `next_page` field. Querying again with the same filters may return new
        events if they were captured after the last request. Once a response
        includes a `next_page` with an `offset`, subsequent requests can be made
        with the latest `offset` to poll for new events that match the provided
        filters.


        *Note: If the filters you provided match events in your domain and
        `next_page` is present in the response, we will continue to send
        `next_page` on subsequent requests even when there are no more events
        that match the filters. This was put in place so that you can implement
        an audit log stream that will return future events that match these
        filters. If you are not interested in future events that match the
        filters you have defined, you can rely on checking empty `data` response
        for the end of current events that match your filters.*


        When no `offset` is provided, the response will begin with the oldest
        events that match the provided filters. It is important to note that
        [AuditLogEvent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) objects will be
        permanently deleted from our systems after 90 days. If you wish to keep
        a permanent record of these events, we recommend using a SIEM tool to
        ingest and store these logs.

        Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and

        these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are

        relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above,
        enum_options

        is only relevant for the enum type and defines the set of choices that

        the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these

        type-specific custom field definitions.

        A specific, existing custom field can be updated by making a PUT request
        on the URL for that custom field. Only the fields provided in the `data`
        block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged

        When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
        to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
        you last retrieved the custom field.

        A custom field’s `type` cannot be updated.

        An enum custom field’s `enum_options` cannot be updated with this
        endpoint. Instead see “Work With Enum Options” for information on how to
        update `enum_options`.

        Locked custom fields can only be updated by the user who locked the
        field.

        Returns the complete updated custom field record.

        Creates an enum option and adds it to this custom field’s list of enum
        options. A custom field can have at most 500 enum options (including
        disabled options). By default new enum options are inserted at the end
        of a custom field’s list.

        Locked custom fields can only have enum options added by the user who
        locked the field.

        Returns the full record of the newly created enum option.

        A `GET` request to the endpoint `/[path_to_resource]/events` can be made
        in

        lieu of including the resource ID in the data for the request.


        Asana limits a single sync token to 100 events. If more than 100 events
        exist

        for a given resource, `has_more: true` will be returned in the response,

        event. This may be different from the one that the events were requested

        Note that portfolios created in the Asana UI may have some state
        (like the “Priority” custom field) which is automatically added
        to the portfolio when it is created. Portfolios created via our
        API will *not* be created with the same initial state to allow
        integrations to create their own starting state on a portfolio.

        To form this request, it is recommended to first make a request to [get
        a project template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com). Then, from the
        response, copy the `gid` from the object in the `requested_dates` array.
        This `gid` should be used in `requested_dates` to instantiate a project.


        _Note: The body of this request will differ if your workspace is an
        organization. To determine if your workspace is an organization, use the
        [is_organization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) parameter._

        Create a new project in a workspace or team.

        Every project is required to be created in a specific workspace or
        organization, and this cannot be changed once set. Note that you can use
        the `workspace` parameter regardless of whether or not it is an
        organization.

        If the workspace for your project is an organization, you must also
        supply a `team` to share the project with.

      summary: Add users to a project

      description: >-
        Adds the specified list of users as members of the project. Note that a
        user being added as a member may also be added as a *follower* as a
        result of this operation. This is because the user's default
        notification settings (i.e., in the "Notifcations" tab of "My Profile
        Settings") will override this endpoint's default behavior of setting
        "Tasks added" notifications to `false`.

        Returns the updated project record.

        Creates and returns a job that will asynchronously handle the project

        while the resulting project template can be accessed with the API, it
        won't be visible in the Asana

        UI until Project Templates 2.0 is launched in the app. See more in [this

        Updates the properties of a tag. Only the fields provided in the `data`
        block will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

        When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
        to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
        you last retrieved the tag.

        Creating a new task is as easy as POSTing to the `/tasks` endpoint with
        a

        data block containing the fields you’d like to set on the task. Any

        unspecified fields will take on default values.


        Every task is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this

        workspace cannot be changed once set. The workspace need not be set

        explicitly if you specify `projects` or a `parent` task instead.

      description: |-
        Adds the task to the specified project, in the optional location
        specified. If no location arguments are given, the task will be added to
        the end of the project.

        `addProject` can also be used to reorder a task within a project or
        section that already contains it.

        At most one of `insert_before`, `insert_after`, or `section` should be
        specified. Inserting into a section in an non-order-dependent way can be
        done by specifying section, otherwise, to insert within a section in a
        particular place, specify `insert_before` or `insert_after` and a task
        within the section to anchor the position of this task.

        Returns an empty data block.

        - Tasks
      summary: Search tasks in a workspace
      operationId: Tasks_searchInWorkspace
      description: >-
        To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search
        feature, the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to
        build complex filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need.

        #### Premium access

        Like the Asana web product's advance search feature, this search
        endpoint will only be available to premium Asana users. A user is
        premium if any of the following is true:


        - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium
        workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace


        Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium
        workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the
        workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request
        using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment
        Required` error.

        #### Pagination

        Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times
        may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not
        change. Because of this, the traditional
        [pagination](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#pagination) available
        elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can
        paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time
        and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have
        already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can
        be specified by the `limit` query parameter.

        #### Eventual consistency

        Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web
        product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be
        indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete
        under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents.
        Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular
        search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the
        advanced search feature in the web product.

        #### Rate limits

        You may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our
        [rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#rate-limits).

        #### Custom field parameters

        | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type |

        |---|---|---|

        | custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.ends_with | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.contains | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number |



        For example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query
        parameter to find tasks where it is set would be
        `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To match an exact value for an enum
        custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option and not the name of
        the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`.


        **Not Supported**: searching for multiple exact matches of a custom
        field, searching for multi-enum custom field


        *Note: If you specify `projects.any` and `sections.any`, you will
        receive tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section. If you're
        looking for only tasks in a section, omit the `projects.any` from the
        request.*

        Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an
        auto-completion/typeahead

        search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so
        do

        not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The

        result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size,
        so

        you won’t be able to fetch large numbers of results.


        The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single

        workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when

        creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant

        to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or

        exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and

        cannot be paginated.


        Queries return a compact representation of each object which is
        typically

        the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all
        of

        the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what

        data is included in a response.


        Resources with type `user` are returned in order of most contacted to

        least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user

        to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages,

        etc.


        Resources with type `project` are returned in order of recency. This is

        determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project,
        and

        completes tasks in the project.


        Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks

        the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks.


        Resources with type `project_template` are returned with priority

        placed on favorited project templates.


        Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, still

        following the resource ordering above. This could be used to list users
        or

        projects that are relevant for the requesting user's api token.

      summary: Establish a webhook
      operationId: Webhooks_establishWebhook
      description: >-
        Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST

        request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource.


        Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake.

        When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with
        an

        `X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204

        No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this

        webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing

        this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures.


        The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status

        of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation

        handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in

        response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to

        receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight

        (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).


        Invalid hostnames like localhost will recieve a 403 Forbidden status
        code.

        Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to
        conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other
        times requests return more information than you may need. This option
        allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure
        to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths,
        described below.

        field options.

                This array specifies the possible values which an `enum` custom
                field can adopt. To modify the enum options, refer to [working

            precision:
              description: >-
                Only relevant for custom fields of type ‘Number’. This field
                dictates the number of places after the decimal to round to,
                i.e. 0 is integer values, 1 rounds to the nearest tenth, and so
                on. Must be between 0 and 6, inclusive.

                For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of
                0.25 has a precision of 0, while a value of 0.251 has a
                precision of 1. This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%.

                The identifier format will always have a precision of 0.
              type: integer

            Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
            adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but
            no more than 500.


            You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
            /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


            **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
            enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to
            false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other
            attributes can be updated similarly.


            On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
            meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field.
            Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option
            in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum
            option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value
            was previously set within a task, the task will retain the value.


            Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
            inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options
            can be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or
            `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only one of
            `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when creating a
            new enum option.


            An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST
            /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert` endpoint.

    EventResponse:

        An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was
        observed by an event subscription or delivered asynchronously to
        the target location of an active webhook.

        The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the
        subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B
        modified it, the event’s user will be user B. Note: Some events
        are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API
        consumers should make sure to handle this case.

        The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one
        that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For
        example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks
        contained within the project.

        **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields
        `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.
        `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource
        itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information
        within the resource's fields have been modified.

        For instance, consider these scenarios:


        * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be
        `added`, `Event.parent` will be an object with the `id` and
        `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.


        * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be
        `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
        `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `new_value` will
        be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.


        * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will
        be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
        `Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be
        an object with the user's `id` and `type`.
