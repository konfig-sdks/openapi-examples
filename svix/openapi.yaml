    # Introduction


    This is the reference documentation and schemas for the [Svix webhook
    service](https://www.svix.com) API. For tutorials and other documentation
    please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.svix.com).


    ## Main concepts


    In Svix you have four important entities you will be interacting with:


    - `messages`: these are the webhooks being sent. They can have contents and
    a few other properties.

    - `application`: this is where `messages` are sent to. Usually you want to
    create one application for each user on your platform.

    - `endpoint`: endpoints are the URLs messages will be sent to. Each
    application can have multiple `endpoints` and each message sent to that
    application will be sent to all of them (unless they are not subscribed to
    the sent event type).

    - `event-type`: event types are identifiers denoting the type of the message
    being sent. Event types are primarily used to decide which events are sent
    to which endpoint.



    ## Authentication


    Get your authentication token (`AUTH_TOKEN`) from the [Svix
    dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com) and use it as part of the
    `Authorization` header as such: `Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}`. For
    more information on authentication, please refer to the [authentication
    token docs](https://docs.svix.com/api-keys).





    ## Code samples


    The code samples assume you already have the respective libraries installed
    and you know how to use them. For the latest information on how to do that,
    please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.svix.com/).



    ## Idempotency


    Svix supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) for
    safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation
    twice. This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do
    not receive a response.


    To perform an idempotent request, pass the idempotency key in the
    `Idempotency-Key` header to the request. The idempotency key should be a
    unique value generated by the client. You can create the key in however way
    you like, though we suggest using UUID v4, or any other string with enough
    entropy to avoid collisions.


    Svix's idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the
    first request made for any given idempotency key for any successful request.
    Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result for a period of
    up to 12 hours.


    Please note that idempotency is only supported for `POST` requests.



    ## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing


    This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in
    compliance with [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). And that allows
    cross-domain communication from the browser. All responses have a wildcard
    same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone,
    including any code on any site.

      Endpoints are the URLs messages will be sent to. Each application can have

        Create new or unarchive existing event type.


        Unarchiving an event type will allow endpoints to filter on it and
        messages to be sent with it.

        Endpoints filtering on the event type before archival will continue to
        filter on it.

        This operation does not preserve the description and schemas.

        The `before` and `after` parameters let you filter all items created
        before or after a certain date. These can be used alongside an iterator
        to paginate over results

        within a certain window.


        Note that by default this endpoint is limited to retrieving 90 days'
        worth of data

        relative to now or, if an iterator is provided, 90 days before/after the
        time indicated

        by the iterator ID. If you require data beyond those time ranges, you
        will need to explicitly

        set the `before` or `after` parameter as appropriate.

        Creates a new message and dispatches it to all of the application's
        endpoints.


        The `eventId` is an optional custom unique ID. It's verified to be
        unique only up to a day, after that no verification will be made.

        If a message with the same `eventId` already exists for any application
        in your environment, a 409 conflict error will be returned.


        The `eventType` indicates the type and schema of the event. All messages
        of a certain `eventType` are expected to have the same schema. Endpoints
        can choose to only listen to specific event types.

        Messages can also have `channels`, which similar to event types let
        endpoints filter by them. Unlike event types, messages can have multiple
        channels, and channels don't imply a specific message content or schema.


        The `payload` property is the webhook's body (the actual webhook
        message). Svix supports payload sizes of up to ~350kb, though it's
        generally a good idea to keep webhook payloads small, probably no larger
        than 40kb.

        The `before` parameter lets you filter all items created before a
        certain date and is ignored if an iterator is passed.


        Note that by default this endpoint is limited to retrieving 90 days'
        worth of data

        relative to now or, if an iterator is provided, 90 days before/after the
        time indicated

        by the iterator ID. If you require data beyond those time ranges, you
        will need to explicitly

        set the `before` or `after` parameter as appropriate.

        Note that by default this endpoint is limited to retrieving 90 days'
        worth of data

        relative to now or, if an iterator is provided, 90 days before/after the
        time indicated

        by the iterator ID. If you require data beyond those time ranges, you
        will need to explicitly

        set the `before` or `after` parameter as appropriate.
