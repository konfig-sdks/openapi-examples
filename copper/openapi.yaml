  description: >-
    The Copper Web API allows you to access and build your own applications that
    interact with Copper in more complex ways than the integrations we provide
    out of the box.


    The Copper Developer API ("Dev API") provides a RESTful interface with
    JSON-formatted responses to access most Copper resources. We are
    continuously working on expanding our API functionality, so stay tuned!


    Authentication

    ===================

    The Dev API uses a token based authentication. You have to include the token
    in the header of every request, along with the email address of the user who
    generated the token. Each Copper user can generate API keys and can have
    multiple valid tokens at the same time. Admins can see all user generated
    tokens.


    To generate an API token, in the Copper web app go to System settings > API
    Keys and click the 'CREATE A KEY' button. Copper allows you to label each
    key for its unique purpose. You'll need to generate an API key to make an
    API Request.


    Requests

    ========

    **Encryption**


    All requests must be sent using HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. Please make
    sure your developer tools support this version of TLS as older versions or
    SSL are not supported for security reasons.


    **Headers**


    All Copper API calls must include the following headers to authenticate the
    request:


    |       Key        |            Value             |

    | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |

    | X-PW-AccessToken | _API Key_                    |

    | X-PW-Application | "developer_api"              |

    | X-PW-UserEmail   | _Email address of token owner_ |

    | Content-Type     | "application/json"           |


    **Body**


    For PUT or POST requests (e.g. create, update, search), the request
    parameters must be provided as JSON in the request body.


    **Rate limits**


    All API calls are limited to 180 requests every minute. Once either limit
    has been reached, calls will return and error with status code 429. This
    rate limit is evaluated on a rolling window basis.


    Responses

    =========


    Responses use the customary [HTTP status
    codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes), with the
    most typical ones being:


    |          Code          |        Meaning        |

    | ---------------------- | --------------------- |

    | *Successful Responses* |                       |

    | 200                    | OK                    |

    | *Error Responses*      |                       |

    | 400                    | Bad Request           |

    | 401                    | Unauthorized          |

    | 429                    | Too many requests     |

    | 500                    | Internal Server Error |


    Each of the entities in the Dev API (Leads, People, etc.) has a '/search'
    endpoint. For requests sent to '/search' endpoints, the response header
    contains a field called 'X-PW-TOTAL'. This value represents an upper bound
    of the total number of records returned in the search query. It allows the
    developer to estimate roughly how long it would take to extract the data
    when the results are paginated (See Paginating Search Results section).


    Search

    ======================


    **Search by Phone Number**


    There are two types of phone number search, fuzzy and partial. The
    difference is in the way the input is permuted prior to search. In general,
    fuzzy search returns more results, but partial search returns results that
    are closer to what the user entered. Let's illustrate from an example.
    Suppose the user enters "408-555-1234". In either search, non-numeric
    characters are stripped first.


    Partial Search: "4085551234" is searched in the database for all records
    that have phone numbers that end in "4085551234". This includes entities
    with phone numbers such as "4085551234", "1-4085551234", "123-4085551234",
    etc.


    Fuzzy Search: "4085551234" is permuted first by stripping 1-6 digits from
    the beginning of the sequence. If the resulting sequence is less than 6
    digits long, it is dropped from the search. In this case, the search string
    set is "4085551234", "085551234", "85551234", "5551234", "551234". Any
    records in the database where the phone number ends in the string set is
    returned. The query results form fuzzy match includes results from the
    partial search and many more ambiguous results. For example, records with
    phone number such as "5105551234" would also be returned.


    To designate the type of phone number search, specify the "match" field when
    entering the phone number in the search request body. E.g.,


    { "phone_number": { "value": "5551234", "match": "partial" } }


    Match scheme is partial if the input string is 6 digits or fewer. For an
    input string 7 digits or more, the default behavior is fuzzy search if a
    match scheme is not specified.


    Paginating search results

    ======================


    Our /search endpoints return multiple records per response. How many records
    are included in a single response (=page size) is determined by an optional
    search parameter called "page_size". The default value for "page_size" is
    20, and its value can be set to any integer between 1 and 200. When the
    search criteria match more records than what fits on a single page then you
    have to paginate the search results using one of the following strategies in
    order to get all the records that match your search.


    Strategy 1: Calculate the number of pages

    ---------------------------


    Every response from a /search endpoint has a field in the response header
    called 'X-PW-TOTAL'. It shows an upper bound of the total number of records
    that match the search criteria.



    To calculate the number of pages to cycle thru, divide the total number of
    records by the page size. For the sake of example, let's assume that the
    page size is 200 and the total number of records is 775. The number of pages
    is 775/200 = 3.875 which rounded up to the nearest integer gives us 4 pages.



    Now, to cycle thru the pages we need to set the "page_number" parameter in
    the request to 1 initially, and then send additional requests for the
    subsequent pages.



    The request header will look like this:



    _For the first page_



    {


    ...


    "page_size": 200,


    "page_number": 1


    ...


    }



    _For the second page_


    {


    ...


    "page_size": 200,


    "page_number": 2


    ...


    }


    and so on.


    This strategy has one caveat; if records are added/modified in the system
    between the time when the header field is evaluated and when the actual
    pages are requested then those records may be included or omitted in/from
    the results incorrectly.


    Strategy 2: Count the records on each page

    ------------------

    In this scenario, we send a search request and specify the first page, by
    setting "page_number" to 1. Then use a logic that performs the following
    evaluation on the response.



    1. Count the number of records in the response

    2. Check if the record count equals the page_size

    3. a. If the record is less than the page size then we are on the last page
    and we can stop paginating

    3. b. If the record count equals the page size then increase "page_size" by
    one, send another request and start over with this evaluation logic.



    Using the same example as above, with a page size of 200 and 775 total
    records the evaluation would go down as follows


    _Page 1_


    {


    ...


    "page_size": 200,


    "page_number": 1


    ...


    }


    The response will have 200 records which equals the page size, so let's
    continue requesting.


    _Page 2_


    {


    ...


    "page_size": 200,


    "page_number": 2


    ...


    }


    The response will have 200 records which equals the page size, so let's
    continue requesting. The 3rd page will have identical results.


    _Page 4 (last page)_


    {


    ...


    "page_size": 200,


    "page_number": 4


    ...


    }


    The response will have 175 records, which is LESS than the page size, which
    tells us we are on the last page and we can stop paginating.


    Remember to sort you search results!

    -------------------

    It is highly recommended that you sort the results you get back from a
    /search endpoint. This ensures that records are returned in a consistent
    fashion across requests. One common sorting scenario is to sort records by
    the date they were last updated, in a descending order. For this sorting
    please add the following parameters to the search request:


    {


    ...


    "sort_by": "date_modified",


    "sort_direction": "desc"


    ...


    }



    Best practices

    ==============

    **Date formats**


    Date formats are in Unix Timestamp format and values are set and returned as
    10 digit long integers (For example {"date_created": 1483988828}). There are
    a few notable exceptions, however. The "close_date" on Opportunities, Task
    Due Dates and Reminder dates, and custom date fields use an ISO "mm/dd/yyyy"
    format for setting and returning date values.



    **The API respects Team Permissions**


    A user's access to records in Copper may be restricted by Team Permission
    settings. The Dev API respects team permissions. It is recommended to use
    the API credentials of an admin user when using the Dev API because Admins
    have unrestricted data access.


    **Create a Developer User**


    If you use the Dev API to create records in Copper, it is advisable to
    create a separate (non-personal) user just for integration purposes.
    Generate API credentials for this user and use those for integration. This
    way records created thru the Dev API will be owned by this integration user
    and can be filtered accordingly.


    **Entity ID scopes**


    Unique identifiers are unique within the scope of a single resource type.
    For example, a given identifier for a Lead will never be assigned to a
    different Lead, but a different resource such as a Person could use the same
    identifier.


    **File Upload**


    Currently, the Developer API does not allow for file uploads. There is a
    workaround available.


    1. Create a custom URL field.

    2. Upload your file to Google Drive.

    3. Push the created file link into your Copper custom URL field.

      Copper keeps a record of activities for People, Leads, Opportunities, and
      Companies. The Activities API allows you to view, create, edit, and delete
      activities.

      Activities behave uniquely in that deleted activities can be accessed
      through the API. However, they will appear only as stubs, identical to the
      response returned by the delete method, and cannot be modified.


      Only "User" type Activities can be created or modified using the developer
      API. "System" type Activities are read-only.

      Webhooks allow systems integrated with Copper to receive near real-time
      notification of certain events so that data updates and workflows can be
      triggered.


      Webhook concepts

      -----


      **Subscription**

      Register a URL that notifications will be sent to when a specific event
      type occurs.


      **Event**

      A specific action in Copper that triggers a notification.


      **Notification**

      The object delivered by an https request (webhook) to the specified URL.


      Event Types

      -----


      The following events are available for subscription:

      - **Create** = a new record is created

      - **Update** = any field in the existing entity record is changed.
      Excludes: new entity relationships, new Activity or any change in meta
      data

      - **Delete** = an existing record is removed


      Events are available for the different entity types as follows.


      | Record Type | Create | Update | Delete | type  |

      | ----------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |

      | Lead        | yes    | yes    | yes    | "lead"|

      | Person      | yes    | yes    | yes    | "person"|

      | Company     | yes    | yes    | yes    | "company" |

      | Opportunity | yes    | yes    | yes    | "opportunity"|

      | Project     | yes    | yes    | yes    | "project"|

      | Task        | yes    | yes    | yes    | "task"|

      | Activity    | yes    | yes    | yes    | "activity_log"|


      Technical considerations

      -----

      **Subscription count**


      You may have up to 100 active subscriptions per account.


      **Rate limits**


      The number of notifications sent are bound by the following limits:

      - 600 notifications per minute per account

      - 1,800 notifications per account for every 10 minutes


      **Multi-event notifications**


      Our notifications always send an array with the IDs of the records
      involved. The array contains at least 1 ID and may contain up to 30 ID's
      in a single notification. If more than 30 records are affected then we
      send multiple notifications, each with up to 30 IDs. Each notification
      counts as a single request towards the rate limit, regardless of the
      number of IDs it contains.


      **Retries**


      Our notifications are fired not more than once per event, and we do not
      retry them, regardless of the status returned by the notification
      endpoint.


      **HTTPS only**


      For security reasons only https:// endpoints are accepted for the
      notification URL.

      resource type. For example, a given identifier for a Lead will never be
      assigned to a different Lead, but a different resource such as a Person
      could use the same identifier.*

      Use connect fields to create custom relationships between records. Common
      examples include keeping track of the relationship between parent/child
      companies, people to people referrals, assignments, managers, investors
      and more. For more use cases, please refer to this [help
      article](https://support.copper.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001739248-Working-with-Connect-Fields).
    name: Connect Fields
  - description: >-
      Copper supports relating Leads, People, Companies, Opportunities, Projects
      and Tasks to each other. In the web and mobile applications, these
      relationships are typically shown in a "Related Items" sections. The
      Related Items API allows you to relate resources to each other, to view a
      resource's related items, and to remove relationships between resources.


      All relationships are bidirectional, i.e. relating Resource A to Resource
      B is functionally equivalent to relating Resource B to Resource A.
      Relationships can only exist between certain types of entities, and
      additional restrictions may apply. The following are the allowed
      relationships between Copper resources:


      - Leads: Tasks

      - People: Companies (limit 1), Opportunities, Tasks, Projects

      - Companies: Opportunities, People, Tasks, Projects

      - Opportunities: Companies, People, Tasks, Projects

      - Projects: Companies, People, Opportunities, Tasks

      - Tasks: Companies, People, Opportunities, Leads, Projects (limit 1 total)


      The request URLs for each of these operations are constructed as follows.
      To find all records related to an entity (e.g. leads), the API endpoint
      is:


      https://api.copper.com/developer_api/v1/leads/{{example_lead_id}}/related


      To find all entities (e.g. tasks) related to a particular entity (e.g.
      leads), the API endpoint is:


      https://api.copper.com/developer_api/v1/leads/{{example_lead_id}}/related/tasks


      The entities leads and tasks in the above examples can be replaced with
      any entity types that are related to each other (see above for the
      complete list).


      **Notes**


      Related Items may be added or removed, but not modified. (To "modify" a
      Related Item, remove it and add a new one.)



      The Related Items API uses Identifiers (as opposed to full objects) to
      uniquely identify related items.

        **Functionality**


        "Upsert" (update + insert) will atomically do the following:

        1. Check for the existence of a Lead matching certain criteria

        1. If one exists, update it with the supplied parameters.

        1. If not, create a new Lead with the supplied parameters.

        1. This is particularly useful to avoid creating duplicate Leads.


        **Match Criteria**


        The supported match criteria are:

        * Name

        * Email

        * Custom Fields


        To match on a Custom Field, the corresponding Custom Field Definition
        must be available on Leads and included in filters. (These settings may
        be viewed and edited in the web application via System Settings ->
        Custom Fields.)


        **Match Outcomes**


        Match outcomes are handled as follows:


        * If no matches are found, create a new Lead.

        * If exactly one match is found, update that Lead.

        * If more than one match is found, return a 422 response with the IDs of
        the matching Leads.

        * If more than 30 matches are found, return a 422 response without the
        IDs of the matching Leads.

      description: >-
        This request creates a Person record from a Lead record. Optionally, a
        Company and an Opportunity record can be created as well in the same
        process. The Lead record is removed after it has been converted.


        | Field       | Type   | Details |

        | -----       | ----   | ------- |

        | person      | object | Details about the Person to be created by the
        Lead conversion. Valid fields are name, contact_type_id, and
        assignee_id.

        | company     | object | Details about the Company to which the newly
        created Person will belong. Valid fields are id or name, and they are
        mutually exclusive. If a Company id is specified, the new Person will
        belong to that Company. If the name of an existing Company is specified,
        the new Person will belong to that Company. If a new name is specified,
        a new Company will be created with that name, and the new Person will
        belong to that Company. If you explicitly supply an empty string ("")
        for the company name, then no Company will be created. By default, fuzzy
        matching will return a list of candidate companies. An optional Boolean
        field "exact_match" can be specified if the exact company name is known.

        | opportunity | object | Details about the Opportunity to be created by
        the Lead conversion. Valid fields are name, pipeline_id,
        pipeline_stage_id, monetary_value, and assignee_id. If unspecified, no
        Opportunity will be created. If pipeline_stage_id is unspecified, it
        will default to the first stage in the pipeline. |

        The /search endpoint provides the ability to list Leads and sort the
        results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided
        records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria
        have an 'AND' relationship).


        To see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on
        the `Leads Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be filtered
        by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not
        specified. For Leads, these fields are: city, state, postal_code, tags,
        custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. For an example of how this
        works, see `Search Leads by Empty Field`. Some fields (e.g.
        assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the
        ID.


        To search by custom fields, see `Search Entity by Custom Field` under
        `Custom Fields` folder.


        To change the number of records returned, change the "page_size"
        parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.

                        A Lead is someone you've qualified as a potential
                        client. When you are ready to start making a deal,
                        simply convert the Lead into an Opportunity.


                        Once your Lead becomes an Opportunity, you'll be able to
                        track progress between each stage of the deal making
                        process in your fully customizable Opportunity Pipeline.
                        Add your own Lead and convert it to an Opportunity to
                        see how it works!

                        A Lead is someone you've qualified as a potential
                        client. When you are ready to start making a deal,
                        simply convert the Lead into an Opportunity.


                        Once your Lead becomes an Opportunity, you'll be able to
                        track progress between each stage of the deal making
                        process in your fully customizable Opportunity Pipeline.
                        Add your own Lead and convert it to an Opportunity to
                        see how it works!

                        A Lead is someone you've qualified as a potential
                        client. When you are ready to start making a deal,
                        simply convert the Lead into an Opportunity.


                        Once your Lead becomes an Opportunity, you'll be able to
                        track progress between each stage of the deal making
                        process in your fully customizable Opportunity Pipeline.
                        Add your own Lead and convert it to an Opportunity to
                        see how it works!

                        A Lead is someone you've qualified as a potential
                        client. When you are ready to start making a deal,
                        simply convert the Lead into an Opportunity.


                        Once your Lead becomes an Opportunity, you'll be able to
                        track progress between each stage of the deal making
                        process in your fully customizable Opportunity Pipeline.
                        Add your own Lead and convert it to an Opportunity to
                        see how it works!

        updates will be made. To remove the value from a field, the request body
        must specify the target field value as 'null'.


        The field `company_id` is returned in the JSON response, However, if you
        would like to unrelate and relate a new `company_id`, use the related
        items API call to delete and then add a new `company_id` to the person
        record. For more info, see `Related Items` folder.

      summary: List People (Search)
      operationId: 3People_listPeopleSearch
      description: >-
        The /search endpoint provides the ability to list people and sort the
        results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided
        records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria
        have an 'AND' relationship).


        To see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on
        the `People Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be
        filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not
        specified. For Leads, these fields are: city, state, postal_code, tags,
        custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. Some fields (e.g.
        assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the
        ID.


        To change the number of records returned, change the "page_size"
        parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.

      description: >-
        The /search endpoint provides the ability to list Companies and sort the
        results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided
        records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria
        have an 'AND' relationship).


        To see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on
        the `Companies Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be
        filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not
        specified. For Companies, these fields are: city, state, postal_code,
        tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. For an example of how
        this works, see `Search Companies by Empty Field`. Some fields (e.g.
        assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the
        ID.


        To search by custom fields, see `Search Entity by Custom Field` under
        `Custom Fields` folder.


        To change the number of records returned, change the "page_size"
        parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.

                        Overview: ProsperWorks is the world's first zero input
                        CRM. Designed specifically for Google Apps, ProsperWorks
                        helps companies sell more faster by identifying,
                        organizing and tracking sales opportunities right in
                        Gmail, Calendar and Google Drive. By removing the need
                        for data entry, salespeople can focus on developing
                        business and managers can finally have accurate
                        forecasting with real time activity tracking.
                        ProsperWorks was founded by Jon Lee, Kelly Cheng and
                        Andrew Hu with the commitment to empower small business
                        sales and marketing. Jon was Founder/CEO of three big
                        data companies that solved optimization problems in
                        advertising, gaming and photo sharing. Each company
                        realized successful exits. The team also includes the
                        leaders in engineering and product from Facebook Mobile,
                        BaseCRM and Salesforce. ProsperWorks has raised $10
                        million in funding from True Ventures, Bloomberg Beta,
                        Crunchfund and other high-profile angel investors.
                        ProsperWorks is based in San Francisco, CA.

      description: >-
        The /search endpoint provides the ability to list records and sort the
        results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided then
        records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria
        have an 'AND' relationship).


        To see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on
        the `Opportunities Search` dropdown on the right.Certain fields can be
        filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not
        specified. For Opportunities, these fields are: company_ids, tags,
        custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. For an example of how this
        works, see `Search Opportunities by Empty Field`. Some fields (e.g.
        assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the
        ID.


        To search by custom fields, see `Search Entity by Custom Field` under
        `Custom Fields` folder.


        To change the number of records returned, change the "page_size"
        parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.

      description: >-
        The /search endpoint provides the ability to list records and sort the
        results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided
        records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria
        have an 'AND' relationship).


        To see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on
        the `Projects Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be
        filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not
        specified. For Projects, these fields are: tags, custom dropdown, custom
        multi-select fields. For an example of how this works, see `Search
        Project by Empty Field`. Some fields (e.g. assignee_ids) can also filter
        for an empty value by specifying -2 as the ID.


        To search by custom fields, see `Search Entity by Custom Field` under
        `Custom Fields` folder.


        To change the number of records returned, change the "page_size"
        parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.

                        Overview: ProsperWorks is the world's first zero input
                        CRM. Designed specifically for Google Apps, ProsperWorks
                        helps companies sell more faster by identifying,
                        organizing and tracking sales opportunities right in
                        Gmail, Calendar and Google Drive. By removing the need
                        for data entry, salespeople can focus on developing
                        business and managers can finally have accurate
                        forecasting with real time activity tracking.
                        ProsperWorks was founded by Jon Lee, Kelly Cheng and
                        Andrew Hu with the commitment to empower small business
                        sales and marketing. Jon was Founder/CEO of three big
                        data companies that solved optimization problems in
                        advertising, gaming and photo sharing. Each company
                        realized successful exits. The team also includes the
                        leaders in engineering and product from Facebook Mobile,
                        BaseCRM and Salesforce. ProsperWorks has raised $10
                        million in funding from True Ventures, Bloomberg Beta,
                        Crunchfund and other high-profile angel investors.
                        ProsperWorks is based in San Francisco, CA.

      description: >-
        The /search endpoint provides the ability to list people and sort the
        results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided
        records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria
        have an 'AND' relationship).


        To see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on
        the `Tasks Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be filtered
        by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not
        specified. For Tasks, these fields are: company, opportunity, city,
        state, postal_code, tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields.
        Some fields (e.g. assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by
        specifying -2 as the ID.


        To search by custom fields, see `Search Entity by Custom Field` under
        `Custom Fields` folder.


        To change the number of records returned, change the "page_size"
        parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.

        The /search endpoint provides the ability to list records and sort the
        results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided
        records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria
        have an 'AND' relationship).


        To see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on
        the `Search Activities` dropdown on the right.

        Footnotes:

        1. Parent is specified by: {"id": parent_id, "type": parent_type}.
        "parent_type" can be "lead", "person", "company", "opportunity",
        "project", "task". 

        2. Activity types is specified by: {"id": activity_type_id, "category":
        category }. "activity_type_id" and "category" can be retrieved from
        `List Activity Types` under `Other Resources` folder.

        3. If the List Activities Search endpoint is timing out, a flag
        `full_result=true` can be added. One can expect to see multiple entries
        returned for the same activity if an email was sent to multiple users.
        In order to use this flag, user must have admin capabilities. Otherwise,
        the flag is ignored.

        Activity Types identify the types of Activities that occur in Copper.
        The Activity Types Developer API allows you to retrieve the list of
        Activity Types associated with your Copper account. There are two
        categories of Activity Type.



        Activity Types with category "user" describe user-entered Activities. By
        default, Copper has three user-entered activity types: Notes, Phone
        Calls, and Meetings. Notes have a hard-coded ID of 0. Phone Calls and
        Meetings are assigned IDs when your Copper account is created. Users may
        also create Custom Activity Types through the Settings page. These will
        be assigned IDs when they are created.



        Custom Activity Types that have been removed from the list in the
        Settings page are not deleted from Copper, because they are necessary to
        correctly handle Activities of those types. These Activity Types are
        visible through the Developer API for Activity Types, and can be used
        for filtering Activity searches, but cannot be used to create new
        Activities.



        Activity Types with category "system" describe system-generated
        Activities. There are currently two system activities: "Property
        Changed" and "Pipeline Stage Changed". They have hard-coded IDs of 1 and
        3 respectively.

        | is_disabled          | boolean | For Custom Activity Types, whether or

        | count_as_interaction | boolean | For Activity Types of category
        "user", whether or not Activities of this type are counted toward
        interactions data. |

        Type objects need only specify the "category" and "id" fields. Any other
        values provided will be ignored.

      summary: Search Entity (Leads, People, etc) by Custom Field
      operationId: CustomFields_searchEntityByCustomField
      description: >-
        Custom fields are available for each of the entities (Leads, People,
        Companies, Opportunities, Projects, and Tasks). Custom field types
        include: Text Field, Text Area, Dropdown, Date, Checkbox, Number Field,
        URL, Percentage, Currency, and Multi-Select Dropdown. Text fields are
        not searchable at this point. The table below summarizes the behavior of
        each of these fields.


        | Field                 | Type          | Search for Empty Value? | Any,
        All, None Options |

        | --------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
        ---------------------- |

        | Dropdown              | integer array | Yes                     |
        No                     |

        | Date                  | integer range | No                      |
        No                     |

        | Checkbox              | boolean       | No                      |
        No                     |

        | Number Field          | numeric       | No                      |
        No                     |

        | Percentage            | numeric range | No                      |
        No                     |

        | Currency              | integer range | No                      |
        No                     |

        | Multi-Select Dropdown | integer array | Yes                     |
        Yes                    |


        Except for text-related fields, each custom field can be searched via
        the dev API search endpoint for any of the entities. For Leads, this
        would be the endpoint `/leads/search`.


        Dropdown and Multi-Select Dropdown fields have the additional option of
        searching for records where dropdown and multi-select dropdown fields
        are empty. This can be accomplished by adding an additional field: {
        "allow_empty": true }. Searching by Multi-select dropdown also allows
        searching if any, all, or none of the dropdown options are to be
        searched. These options can be used together.


        Examples of searching for each of the searchable fields can be found
        under the dropdown menu on the right. Examples given are for `Leads` and
        can be easily interchanged with any other entity.

                        A Lead is someone you've qualified as a potential
                        client. When you are ready to start making a deal,
                        simply convert the Lead into an Opportunity.


                        Once your Lead becomes an Opportunity, you'll be able to
                        track progress between each stage of the deal making
                        process in your fully customizable Opportunity Pipeline.
                        Add your own Lead and convert it to an Opportunity to
                        see how it works!

                        A Lead is someone you've qualified as a potential

        Also, you may specify an optional hash object called "secret" containing
        custom key/value pairs that is sent with every notification. Using this
        secret your notification endpoint can authenticate the request to make
        sure it is coming from a trusted source.


        This example shows the creation of a new notification for events when
        existing Leads are updated.

            Overview: ProsperWorks is the world's first zero input CRM. Designed
            specifically for Google Apps, ProsperWorks helps companies sell more
            faster by identifying, organizing and tracking sales opportunities
            right in Gmail, Calendar and Google Drive. By removing the need for
            data entry, salespeople can focus on developing business and
            managers can finally have accurate forecasting with real time
            activity tracking. ProsperWorks was founded by Jon Lee, Kelly Cheng
            and Andrew Hu with the commitment to empower small business sales
            and marketing. Jon was Founder/CEO of three big data companies that
            solved optimization problems in advertising, gaming and photo
            sharing. Each company realized successful exits. The team also
            includes the leaders in engineering and product from Facebook
            Mobile, BaseCRM and Salesforce. ProsperWorks has raised $10 million
            in funding from True Ventures, Bloomberg Beta, Crunchfund and other
            high-profile angel investors. ProsperWorks is based in San
            Francisco, CA.

              A Lead is someone you've qualified as a potential client. When you
              are ready to start making a deal, simply convert the Lead into an
              Opportunity.


              Once your Lead becomes an Opportunity, you'll be able to track
              progress between each stage of the deal making process in your
              fully customizable Opportunity Pipeline. Add your own Lead and
              convert it to an Opportunity to see how it works!
