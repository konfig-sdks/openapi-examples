    # Introduction


    Welcome to TheirStack’s API!

    <br>

    You can use this API to access all our API endpoints, such as the [Jobs
    endpoint](https://api.theirstack.com) to get real-time and historical jobs
    from more than 100 countries or the [Companies
    endpoint](https://api.theirstack.com) to get a list of companies by the
    technology they use or by the roles they are hiring for.


    The API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). All
    requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including
    errors, are encoded in JSON.


    # Authentication


    Authentication is done via the API key which you can find in [your account
    settings](https://app.theirstack.com/settings/api).

    When making a call, you’ll have to specify this API key with the
    Authorization header. Here’s an example:


    ```sh

    Authorization: Bearer <token>

    ```

            Measures the relative occurance of this technology among other
            technologies in the same category, in jobs by this company. If there
            are 10 jobs where a company mentions 3 categories, and they appear
            in 8, 3 and 2 jobs respectively, its relative occurrences will be
            0.8, 0.3 and 0.2. This helps you infer how likely it is that the
            company is using this technology, when they mention several
            technologies that belong to the same category.

            This is a score we assign to every technology used by each company
            to asses how likely it is that they're using it, combining the value
            of `jobs` and `relative_occurrence_within_category`. The higher this
            value is, the higher the chances that the company uses this
            technology. Values lower than 1 mean it's not very likely they use
            it. Then, the higher the value of theirstack_score, the more likely
            it is that they actually use it.
