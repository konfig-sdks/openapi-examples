            The coordinates to crop the image.<p>If `PERSON_PROFILE` is
            selected, the image will be stretched to an aspect ratio of 1:1 in
            IHR platform. Hence it is recommended to crop the image with an
            aspect ratio of 1:1 to avoid distortions. As an example for a
            `3000x4000` image to cropped to 1:1, the height can be modified to a
            value of 3000px which corresponds to the ratio
            `height=widthpx/heightpx=3000/4000=0.75`. For the height of image to
            be cropped in the center, vertical offset can be defined as
            `y=(1-height)/2=0.125`. With the following example, coordinates of
            `{ x: 0, y: 0.125, width: 1, height: 0.75}` will result in a square
            image that is cropped from the center.</p><p>If `PROFILE_COVER` is
            selected, the image will be stretched to an aspect ratio of 3:1 in
            IHR platform. As an example to avoid distortions, we can use the
            following formula for the new height `newHeightpx=widthpx/3`. The
            new height ratio will be defined as `height=newHeightpx/heightpx`.
            The vertical offset can be adjusted using `y=(1-height)/2` for the
            image height to be cropped from the center.</p>
