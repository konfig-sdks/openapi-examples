    # Authentication


    The public API provides two methods of authentication, ApiKeys and OAuth2.
    The following sections provide information regarding each one and their
    intent.


    ## OAuth2


    > OAuth2 is used to identify individual users, not applications or
    platforms.


    OAuth2 is available for authenticating to the public API and making requests
    via third parties **on behalf of a user**. All actions are authored on
    behalf of the user that creates the token. This means the intent is to be
    used mainly to do submit actions the actual user is performing on an
    alternative interface.


    To generate a token you will require opening an authorization dialog that
    returns a code, this code can then be exchanged for a token.


    ### Configuration


    In order to create an OAuth application, you must be an admin, head over to
    your [personal repository of OAuth
    applications](https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/applications), click on `New
    application` and follow the creation process.


    The Factorial API enforces the same permissions at the user level than the
    Factorial web application. This means that Factorial API users will only be
    able to perform the same actions they are allowed to do in the Factorial
    platform.


    Next step will be to generate the Authorization Code you will need in order
    to generate an OAuth2 Token.


    ### OAuth2 Code Generation


    Should be generated via browser by opening the following url. The user
    should be already logged in to Factorial beforehand.


    `https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=&redirect_uri=&response_type=code&scope=`


    YOUR_CLIENT_ID: OAuth2 Application Id

    REDIRECT_URI: OAuth2 Redirect URL


    #### State Parameter


    An optional query parameter called `state` can be added to the code
    generation url. Any string can be used and will be sent on the callback url.


    > Authorization protocols provide a `state` parameter that allows you to
    restore the previous state of your application. The `state` parameter
    preserves some state objects set by the client in the Authorization request
    and makes it available to the client in the response.


    ### OAuth2 Token Generation


    Once you have the authorization code, you can request their access token to
    Factorial.


    `curl -X POST 'https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/token' -d
    'client_id=&client_secret=&code=&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri='`


    YOUR_CLIENT_ID: OAuth2 Application Id

    YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET: OAuth2 Application Secret

    AUTHORIZATION_CODE: OAuth2 CODE

    REDIRECT_URI: OAuth2 Redirect URL


    > You can generate only one OAuth2 token per Code, that means that if you
    want to generate a new token for a Code that already have one you should
    refresh your token.


    Every time a new token is generated a refresh token is generated as well, so
    that you can use it on the OAuth2 Refresh Token, and an expire date is also
    provided.


    ### OAuth2 Refresh Token


    You can generate a new token under the same Code with a new expire date (you
    can do it as many times as you need). A refresh token is also returned here
    so that you can use it on the OAuth2 Refresh Token again.


    `curl -X POST 'https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/token' -d
    'client_id=&client_secret=&refresh_token=&grant_type=refresh_token'`


    YOUR_CLIENT_ID: OAuth2 Application Id

    YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET: OAuth2 Application Secret

    REFRESH_TOKEN: OAuth2 Refresh Token


    ### OAuth2 Revoke Token


    You can revoke an access/refresh token if you do not want it to be active
    anylonger. This can happen in cases where you have refreshed your token and
    would like to revoke the previous token if you haven't used the new token
    yet, as using the new token automatically revokes the previous one.


    `curl -X POST 'https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/revoke' -d
    'client_id=&client_secret=&token='`


    YOUR_CLIENT_ID: OAuth2 Application Id

    YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET: OAuth2 Application Secret

    TOKEN: OAuth2 Access/Refresh Token (whichever you wish to revoke)


    ### OAuth2 Token Usage


    The generated token is the credential for performing authenticated requests
    to Factorial. This token should be included in the Authorization header
    prefixed with the word Bearer and a separating space.

    As an example, if your token is `12345` then the header content should be
    `Bearer 12345`.


    ### Maintaining a persistent connection


    To maintain a persistent connection, you should not let the token expire.
    You can avoid this by simply refreshing your token before the expiration
    date. This will give you another token with a new expiration date, before
    that token expires you should refresh it again, and so on...

    If you want to do this automatically, you should provide something in your
    code that will help you perform the update every time the token expires.
    Otherwise, you would have to do the update manually and make sure you
    refresh your token before the expiration date to maintain the connection.


    ## ApiKeys


    > API keys are used to identify systems, not the individual users that
    access.


    ApiKeys have **TOTAL ACCESS** to everything and never expire. Its the
    creators responsibility to generate them and store them securely.


    ### Generation


    In the `Core>Keys` section of this documentation you can access the apis for
    managing this resource.


    ### Usage


    ApiKeys are a single string of symbols that must be added as a custom header
    on the request. The header name must be `x-api-key` and the key must be the
    value without any prefixes.


    ### Disclaimer


    ApiKey management require full admin permissions as the resource itself
    allows for full admin access to the entire platform on behalf of the company
    and not of a user, therefore any operations are not linked to any user in
    particular.


    # Development


    ## SDKs


    Coming soon


    ## Sandbox


    A sandbox/demo environment is available for testing integrations via public
    API calls. Developers can request provisioning with full access to a demo
    company where to test code before actually interacting with a production
    environment.


    Contact your account manager or account executive to request this
    environment and get OAuth2 credentials for generating tokens.


    Note: the domain for sandbox is different than that from production. Sandbox
    base domain is `http://api.demo.factorialhr.com`


    ## Postman


    Click the "Run in Postman" button to open the full list of endpoints on your
    Postman workspace as a Postman Collection.

    Inside the collection lookout for the Collection's Variables, configure your
    variables accordingly.


    ### Delegating Token Generation To Postman

    ## Custom Fields


    Custom fields are useful when you want to add some fields that are not the
    default ones, to every employee of the company.


    For that, you have to create via Factorial App the base custom field in
    order to have all the employees with it. That option is available in
    customization, inside the company menu


    Once you have that, via API, you can [Create a value for a custom
    field](https://apidoc.factorialhr.com/#72f3f786-e37d-4e80-ada2-0beedd03b171)
    to each employee. You should know the custom field id in order to make that,
    you can check it by [getting a collection of custom
    fields](https://apidoc.factorialhr.com/#f98dae5a-a8d0-474e-a181-7e9603409b42)

      summary: Create a value for a custom field
      operationId: CustomFieldValue_createCustomValue
      description: >-
        As described, a `Custom Field Value` can be thought of as an
        answer/response to a `Custom Field` these answers/responses belong to
        the entity that inputed the values e.g. an employee who answered the
        t-shirt size question by filling it out in their factorial dashboard.

        This endpoint allows you to create values for custom fields. It requires
        an `instance_id` which refers to the `id` of the entity that owns this
        `Custom Value` e.g. an Employee for which the `employee_id` will
        correspond to the `instance_id`. It also requires a `field_id` to
        reference the `Custom Field` which this value is related to.

        You can think of `Custom Fields` and `Custom Values` as questions and
        answers.
