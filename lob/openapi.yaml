      Lob's URL shortener allows you to generate unique short links, either with
      Lob's own domain or your own custom domains. Each custom link enables Lob
      to track mail individually and provide customers the relevant tracking
      data in their dashboard.


      Webhooks can be used to integrate Lob's URL Shortener scans into your omni
      channel marketing stratergy. See the <a href="#tag/Webhooks">Webhooks</a>
      section of our documentation to learn how to enable the `letter.viewed`,
      `postcard.viewed` and `self_mailer.viewed` event notifications for your
      mail pieces.


      Furthermore, you can use our Retrieve endpoints to track the impact and
      engagement rate of links created.

      ## Intl Verifications Test Env


      When verifying international addresses, you'll likely want to test against

      a wide array of addresses to ensure you're handling responses correctly.

      With your test API key, requests that use specific values for
      `primary_line`

      let you explore the responses to many types of addresses:


      <table>
        <tr>
          <th style="white-space: nowrap">DELIVERABILITY OF SAMPLE RESPONSE</th>
          <th style="white-space: nowrap">SET <code>primary_line</code> TO</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="white-space: nowrap"><code>deliverable</code></td>
          <td style="white-space: nowrap">deliverable</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="white-space: nowrap"><code>deliverable_missing_info</code></td>
          <td style="white-space: nowrap">deliverable missing info</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="white-space: nowrap"><code>undeliverable</code></td>
          <td style="white-space: nowrap">undeliverable</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="white-space: nowrap"><code>no_match</code></td>
          <td style="white-space: nowrap">no match</td>
        </tr>
      </table>


      See the `test` request & response examples under [Intl Verification
      Examples](#operation/intl_verification) within the

      "Verify an international address section" in Intl Verifications.


      You can rely on the response from these examples generally matching the
      response

      you'd see in the live environment with an address of that type (excluding
      the `recipient` field).


      The test API key does not perform any verification, automatic correction,
      or standardization

      for addresses. If you wish to try these features out, use our <a

      values for `address` or `primary_line` and (if using `primary_line`) an
      arbitrary five digit

      number for `zip_code` (e.g. "11111") let you explore the responses to many
      types of addresses:


      <table>
        <tr>
          <th style="white-space: nowrap">ADDRESS TYPE FOR SAMPLE RESPONSE</th>

      Address autocompletion for non-US addresses. Given partial address
      information, this endpoint returns up to 10 address suggestions.

      ## Autocompletion Test Env

      Your test API key does not autocomplete international addresses and is
      used to simulate

      behavior. With your test API key, requests with specific values for
      `address_prefix`

      return predetermined values. When `address_prefix` is set to:

      - `0 suggestions` - Returns no suggestions

      - `[PRIMARY NUMBER] s[uggestion]` - Returns a maximum of ten predefined
      suggested addresses.
        `[PRIMARY NUMBER]` does not have to be a valid primary number when sending a test request.
        Each additional letter in `suggestion` reduces the number of suggestions by one (e.g.
        `1 su` returns 9 suggested addresses). `[PRIMARY NUMBER]` does not affect the number of
        suggestions returned.
      Country is a required field.

      City and state filters work as expected and filter the list of
      predetermined suggested addresses.

      See the `test` request & response examples under [Autocomplete
      Examples](#operation/intl_autocompletions) within the "Autocomplete

      a partial address" section in Intl Autocompletions.

      Furthermore, our QR code Analytics endpoint can be used to track the
      impact and engagement rate of your mail sends. Lob can tell you exactly
      which recipients opened your mailpiece. Our Analytics endpoint allows you

      target="_blank">HTTP Basic authentication</a>.

      In order to properly authenticate with the API you must use your API key
      as the username

      while leaving the password blank. Requests not properly authenticated will
      return a `401`

      [error code](#tag/Errors). You can find your account's API keys

      in your <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/settings/api-keys"
      target="_blank">Dashboard Settings</a>.

      ### Example Request

      curl uses the -u flag to pass basic auth credentials (adding a colon after
      your API key will prevent it from asking you for a

      password). One of our test API keys has been filled into all the examples
      on the page, so you can test out any example right away.

      ```bash

      curl https://api.lob.com/v1/addresses \
        -u test_0dc8dXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX5b0cc:
      ```

      ## API Keys
        Lob authenticates your API requests using your account's API keys.
        If you do not include your key when making an API request, or use
        one that is incorrect or outdated, Lob returns an error with a `401`
        HTTP response code. You can find all API keys in your dashboard
        under <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/settings/api-keys" target="_blank">Settings</a>.
        There are two types of API keys: *secret* and *publishable*.
        - **Secret API keys** should be kept confidential and only stored on your own servers.
        Your account's secret API key can perform any API request to Lob without restriction.
        - **Publishable API keys** are limited to US verifications, international verifications,
        and US autocomplete requests. For maximum security, we encourage you to not expose your 
        secret key. You can include the publishable keys in JavaScript code or in an Android or iPhone app
        without exposing your Lob Print and Mail account services or your secret key. Publishable keys are always
        prefixed with `[environment]_pub`.
        Every type comes with a pair of keys: one for the testing environment and one for the
        live environment. We recommend reading [Test and Live Environments](#tag/Test-and-Live-Environments)
        for more information.

      At Lob, we pride ourselves on building high quality platform capabilities
      rapidly

      and iteratively, so we can constantly be delivering additional value to
      our customers.

      When evaluating a new product or feature from Lob, you may see that it has
      been released in Beta.


      Typically, something in Beta means that the feature is early in its
      lifecycle here at

      Lob. While we fully stand behind the quality of everything we release in
      Beta, we do

      anticipate receiving a higher level of customer feedback on Beta features,
      as well as a

      faster pace of changes from our engineering team in response to that
      feedback.


      By participating in a Lob Beta program, you will have the opportunity to
      get early access

      to a new product capability, as well as having a unique opportunity to
      influence the product's

      direction with your feedback.


      You should also anticipate that features in Beta may have functional or
      design limitations,

      and might change rapidly as we receive customer feedback and make
      improvements. In particular,

      new APIs in Beta may also go through more frequent versioning and version
      deprecation cycles

      than our more mature APIs.


      If you are participating in a Beta program and want to provide feedback,
      please feel free to

      Lob uses RESTful HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an
      API request - read below for more information. In general, 2xx indicates
      success, 4xx indicate an input error, and 5xx indicates an error on Lob's
      end.

      Lob’s Print & Mail and Address Verification APIs help companies transform
      outdated,

      manual print-and-mail processes; save 1,000s of hours in processing time
      by sending mail much more

      quickly; and increase ROI on offline communications.


      Automate direct mail by triggering on-demand postcards, letters, and
      checks directly from your

      CRM or customer data systems.


      Address Verification corrects, standardizes, and cleanses address data for
      assured delivery with

      instant verification across 240+ countries and territories.


      Lob's print delivery network eliminates the hassle of vendor management
      with automated

      production and postage across a global network of vetted commercial
      printers.


      Tracking & Analytics gives you complete visibility of production and
      delivery for each piece of

      mail you send to meet compliance requirements and measure campaign
      performance.

      ## Cancellation Windows


      By default, all new accounts have a 5 minute cancellation window for
      postcards,

      self mailers, letters, and checks. Within that timeframe, you can cancel

      mailings from production, free of charge. Once the window has passed for a

      postcard, self mailer, letter, or check, the mailing is no longer
      cancelable.

      In addition, certain customers can customize their cancellation windows by

      product in their <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/#"
      target="_blank">Dashboard Settings</a>. Upgrade to

      the appropriate <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions"
      target="_blank">Print & Mail Edition</a>

      to automatically gain access to this ability. For more details on this
      feature,

      check out our <a
      href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/building-a-mail-strategy/managing-mail-settings#cancellation-windows-4"
      target="_blank">Cancellation Guide</a>.


      If you schedule a postcard, self mailer, letter, or check for up to 180
      days

      in the future by supplying the `send_date` parameter, that will override
      any

      cancellation window you may have for that product.

      <br>

      <div class="back-to-top" ><a href="#" onclick="toTopLink()">back to
      top</a></div>


      ## Scheduled Mailings


      Postcards, self mailers, letters, and checks can be scheduled to be sent
      up

      to 180 days in advance. You can use this feature to:

      - Create automated drip campaigns (e.g. send a postcard at 15, 30, and 60

      days)

      - Schedule recurring sends

      - Plan your mailing schedule ahead of time


      Up until the time a mailing is scheduled for, it can also be canceled.

      If you use this feature in conjunction with [a cancellation
      window](index.html#section/Cancellation-Windows), the `send_date`
      parameter will always

      take precedence.


      For implementation details, see documentation below for each respective

      endpoint. For more help, see our <a
      href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/building-a-mail-strategy/choosing-a-delivery-strategy#scheduled-mailings-15"
      target="_blank">Scheduled Mailings Guide</a>.


      This feature is exclusive to certain customers. Upgrade to the appropriate

      <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions"
      target="_blank">Print & Mail Edition</a> to

      gain access.

      National Change of Address Linkage (NCOALink) is a service offered by the
      USPS, which allows individuals

      or businesses who have recently moved to have any mail forwarded from
      their previous address

      to their new address.


      As a CASS-certified Address Verification Provider, Lob also offers
      NCOALink

      functionality to our Print & Mail customers. With the Lob NCOALink feature
      enabled, Postcards,

      Letters, Checks and Addresses can automatically be corrected to reflect an
      individual's or business's

      new address in the case that they have moved (only if they have registered
      for NCOALink with the USPS).


      Due to privacy concerns and USPS constraints, for customers with NCOALink
      enabled, our API responses

      for a limited set of endpoints differ slightly in the case when an address
      has been changed through NCOALink.


      **NOTE**: This feature is exclusive to certain customers. Upgrade to the
      appropriate <a href='https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions'
      target="_blank">Print & Mail Editions</a> to gain access.


      For more information, see our <a
      href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/all-about-addresses#national-change-of-address-ncoa-7"
      target="_blank">NCOALink guide</a>.

      <br>

      <div class="back-to-top" ><a href="#" onclick="toTopLink()">back to
      top</a></div>


      ## NCOALink Live Environment

      Though there are no changes to API requests, there are significant changes
      to our API responses, but

      only in the event that an address has been changed through NCOALink. If an
      address has not been changed

      through NCOALink, the response would be identical to our standard
      responses, except the addition of a

      `recipient_moved` field, which is `false` for unchanged addresses.


      If an address has been changed through NCOALink, we are required to
      suppress the following response

      fields for that address:

      - `address_line1`

      - `address_line2`

      - The +4 portion of the ZIP+4 (5-digit ZIP code will still be present)


      See the `ncoa_us_live` example under [Response
      samples](#operation/address_create) within the "Create an Address" section
      in Addresses

      <br>

      <div class="back-to-top" ><a href="#" onclick="toTopLink()">back to
      top</a></div>


      ## NCOALink Test Environment


      In addition to sending live requests, you may also want to simulate what
      an NCOALink response might

      look like so that you can ensure your application behaves as expected. The
      behavior of NCOALink in

      Lob's Test Environment is very similar to our [US Verifications Test
      Mode](#section/US-Verifications-Test-Env).


      To simulate an NCOALink request, send a POST request to any of the four
      endpoints below with an `address_line1` field equal to `NCOA`:

      - `POST /v1/addresses`

      - `POST /v1/checks`

      - `POST /v1/letters`

      - `POST /v1/postcards`

      - `POST /v1/self_mailers`


      A static address will always be returned, as documented in the
      `ncoa_us_test` example under [Response samples](#operation/address_create)
      within the "Create an Address"

      section in Addresses (along with the corresponding request under "Request
      samples").

    name: National Change of Address
    x-traitTag: true
  - description: >-
      To prevent misuse, we enforce a rate limit on an API Key and endpoint
      basis, similar to the way many other APIs enforce rate limits. By default,
      all accounts and their corresponding Test and Live API Keys have a rate
      limit of 150 requests per 5 seconds per endpoint. The `POST
      /v1/us_verifications` and `POST /v1/us_autocompletions` endpoints have a
      limit of 300 requests per 5 seconds for all accounts.


      When your application exceeds the rate limit for a given API endpoint, the
      Lob API will return an HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" response code instead
      of the variety of codes you would find across the other API endpoints.


      **HTTP Headers**


      HTTP headers are returned on each request to a rate limited endpoint.
      Ensure that you inspect these headers during your requests as they provide
      relevant data on how many more requests your application is allowed to
      make for the endpoint you just utilized.


      While the headers are documented here in titlecase, HTTP headers are case
      insensitive and certain libraries may transform them to lowercase. Please
      inspect your headers carefully to see how they will be represented in your
      chosen development scenario.

      ```


      ### Example Response

          "error": {
            "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait 5 seconds and try your request again.",

      ## Asset URLs


      All asset URLs returned by the Lob API (postcards, letters, thumbnails,

      etc) are signed links served over HTTPS. All links returned will expire in

      30 days to prevent mis-sharing. Each time a GET request is initiated, a

      new signed URL will be generated.

      ## Query Parameters


      Query parameters which consist of lists of strings require that all
      elements of

      the list be double-quoted, as per query filter standards.

      <br>

      <div class="back-to-top" ><a href="#" onclick="toTopLink()">back to

      ## Idempotent Requests


      Lob supports idempotency for safely retrying `POST` requests to create

      postcards, self mailers, letters, and checks without accidentally creating

      duplicates.


      For example, if a request to create a check fails due to a network error,

      you can safely retry the same request with the same idempotency key and

      guarantee that only one check will ultimately be created and sent. When a

      request is sent with an idempotency key for an already created resource,

      the response object for the existing resource will be returned.


      To perform an idempotent `POST` request to one of the mailpiece product

      endpoints, provide an additional `Idempotency-Key` header or an
      `idempotency_key`

      query parameter to the request. If multiple idempotency keys are provided,

      the request will fail. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we

      suggest using random values, such as V4 UUIDs. Idempotency keys are
      intended

      to prevent issues over a short periods of time, therefore keys expire
      after

      24 hours. Keys are unique by mode (Test vs. Live) as well as by resource

      (postcard vs. letter, etc.).


      By default, all `GET` and `DELETE` requests are idempotent by nature, so

      they do not require an additional idempotency key.


      For more help integrating idempotency keys, refer to our

      <a

      ## Metadata


      When creating any Lob object, you can include a metadata object with up to
      20 key-value pairs of

      custom data. You can use metadata to store information like
      `metadata[customer_id] = "987654"` or

      `metadata[campaign] = "NEWYORK2015"`. This is especially useful for
      filtering and matching to internal

      systems.


      Each metadata key must be less than 40 characters long and values must be
      less than 500 characters.

      Metadata does not support nested objects.


      ### Example Create Request with Metadata


      ```bash
        curl https://api.lob.com/v1/postcards \
          -u test_0dc8d51e0acffcb1880e0f19c79b2f5b0cc: \
          -d "description=Demo Postcard job" \
          -d "metadata[campaign]=NEWYORK2015" \
          -d "to=adr_bae820679f3f536b" \
          -d "from=adr_210a8d4b0b76d77b" \
          --data-urlencode "front=<html style='margin: 130px; font-size: 50;'>Front HTML for {{name}}</html>" \
          --data-urlencode "back=<html style='margin: 130px; font-size: 50;'>Back HTML</html>" \
          -d "merge_variables[name]=Harry"
      ```


      ### Example List Request with Metadata Filter


      ```bash
        curl -g "https://api.lob.com/v1/postcards?metadata[campaign]=NEWYORK2015&limit=2" \
          -u test_0dc8d51e0acffcb1880e0f19c79b2f5b0cc:
      ```

      ## Request Body


      When manually sending a POST HTTP request directly to the Lob API, without

      the use of a library, you may represent the body as either a Form URL

      Encoded request, a JSON document, or a Multipart Form Data request.


      However, if you're using one of our [SDKs](#tag/SDKs-and-Tools),

      the generation of the request bodies is done for you automatically and you
      don't

      need to worry about the format.


      ### Form URL Encoded


      This request body encoding is accompanied with the

      `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header. The content is
      an

      example of what the [Verify a US
      address](index.html#operation/us_verification)

      endpoint accepts. An example of a request body encoded in this format
      follows.



      ```javascript
        primary_line=210 King Street&city=San Francisco&state=CA&zip_code=94107
      ```


      ### JSON


      This request body encoding is accompanied with the `Content-Type:
      application/json` header.

      The content is an example of what the [Verify a US address
      endpoint](index.html#operation/us_verification)

      accepts. An example of a request body encoded in this format follows.



      ```javascript
        {
          "primary_line": "210 King Street",
          "city": "San Francisco",
          "state": "CA",
          "zip_code": "94107"
        }
      ```


      ### Multipart Form Data


      This request body encoding is accompanied with the `Content-Type:
      multipart/form-data`

      header. This is the only format that can be used for uploading a file to
      the API. The

      content is an example of what the [Create a
      check](index.html#operation/check_create)

      endpoint accepts. An example of a request body encoded in this format
      follows.



      ```javascript
        --------------------------7015ebe79c0a5f8c
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="description"

        Demo Letter

      ## HTML Templates

      You can save commonly used HTML as templates within Lob to more easily
      manage them. You can reference

      your saved templates in postcard, letter, and check requests instead of
      having to pass a long HTML

      string on each request. Additionally, you can make changes to your HTML
      templates and update them

      independently, without having to touch your API integration. Templates can
      be created, edited,

      and viewed on your <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/#/templates"
      target="_blank">Dashboard</a>. To use a template in a postcard,

      letter, or check, see the documentation for each endpoint below. For help
      using templates, check out our

      <a
      href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/designing-mail-creatives/dynamic-personalization#html-templates-1"
      target="_blank">HTML Templates Guide</a> or get started with a

      <a href="https://lob.com/template-gallery" target="_blank">pre-designed
      template from our gallery</a>. In Live mode, you can only have

      as many templates as allotted in your current

      <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions"
      target="_blank">Print & Mail Edition</a>. There is no limit in Test mode.


      If you'd like to interact with templates programmatically, check out our
      Beta Program for API access

      to the [HTML Templates Endpoints](#tag/Templates).


      ### Example Create Request using HTML Templates

      ```bash
        curl https://api.lob.com/v1/postcards \
          -u test_0dc8d51e0acffcb1880e0f19c79b2f5b0cc: \
          -d "description=Demo Postcard job" \
          -d "to=adr_78c304d54912c502" \
          -d "from=adr_61a0865c8c573139" \
          -d "front=tmpl_b846a20859ae11a" \
          -d "back=tmpl_01b0d396a10c268" \
          -d "merge_variables[name]=Harry"
      ```

      <br>

      <div class="back-to-top" ><a href="#" onclick="toTopLink()">back to
      top</a></div>


      ## HTML Examples

      Use a pre-designed template from our <a
      href="https://lob.com/resources/template-gallery"
      target="_blank">gallery</a> or follow these

      basic <a href="https://github.com/lob/examples"
      target="_blank">guidelines</a> as starting points for creating custom
      Postcards,

      Self Mailers, Letters, and Checks.


      Please follow the standards used in these templates, such as:

      - For any linked assets, you must use a performant file hosting provider
      with no rate limits such as Amazon

      S3.

      - Use inline styles or an internal stylesheet, do not link to external
      stylesheets.

      - Link to images that are 300DPI and sized at the final desired size on
      the physical mailing. For example,

      for a photo that is desired to be 1in x 1in on the final postcard, the
      image asset should be sized at 1in

      x 1in at 300DPI (which equates to 300px by 300px).

      - The sum of all linked assets should not exceed 5MB in file size.

      - Use `-webkit` prefixes for CSS properties when recommended <a
      href="http://shouldiprefix.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.


      Because different browsers have varying user-agent styles, the HTML you
      see in your browser will not

      always look identical to what is produced through the API. It is
      **strongly** recommended that you test all

      HTML requests by reviewing the final PDF files in your Test Environment,
      as these are the files that will be

      printed.

      <br>

      <div class="back-to-top" ><a href="#" onclick="toTopLink()">back to
      top</a></div>


      ## Image Prepping

      Currently we support the following file types for all endpoints:

      - PDF

      - PNG

      - JPEG


      **Templates**


      You can find pre-made templates that already adhere to all of these
      guidelines here:

      - [Postcards](#tag/Postcards)

      - [Letters](#tag/Letters)

      - [Checks](#tag/Checks)

      - [Self Mailers](#tag/Self-Mailers)


      **Prepping All Images**


      The following guidelines apply to image types:

      - Images should be 300 dpi or higher - PNG/JPEG files with less than 300
      dpi will be rejected.

      - Your artwork should include a 1/8" border around the final trim size.
      This means your final file size will be a total of 0.25" larger than your
      expected printed piece (ie, a 4"x6" postcard should be submitted as
      4.25"x6.25"). There is no need to include crop marks in your submitted
      content.

      - Include a safe zone – make sure no critical elements are within 1/8"
      from the edge of the final size.

      - Do not include any additional postage marks or indicia.

      - File sizes should be no larger than 5MB.


      **Prepping PDFs**


      To ensure that you are producing PDF's correctly please follow the
      guidelines below:

      - [Make sure all non-standard fonts are
      embedded.](#section/Standard-PDF-Fonts)

      - Generated PDF's need to be be PDF/A compliant.


      **Prepping PNGs/JPEGs**


      To ensure that you are producing PNG's/JPEG's correctly please follow the
      guidelines below:


      - Minimum 300 dpi. The dpi is calculated as (width of image in pixels) /
      (width of product in inches) and (length of image in pixels) / (length of
      product in inches). For Example: 1275px x 1875px image used to create a
      4.25" x 6.25" postcard has a dpi of 300.

      - Submitted images must have the same length to width ratio as the chosen
      product. Images will not be cropped or stretched by the API.

      <br>

      <div class="back-to-top" ><a href="#" onclick="toTopLink()">back to
      top</a></div>


      ## Standard PDF Fonts

      Ideally, all fonts in provided PDFs should be embedded. Embedding a font
      in a PDF ensures that the final

      printed product will look as it was designed. Fonts can vary greatly in
      size and shape, even within the

      same family. If the exact font that was used to design the artwork is not
      used to print, the look and

      placement of the text is not guaranteed to be the same.


      In general, requests that provide PDFs with un-embedded fonts will be
      rejected. We make an exception for

      "standard fonts", a set of fonts that we have identified as being common.
      PDFs that contain un-embedded

      fonts that are found in the list, and match the accepted <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Font_formats"
      target="_blank">font type</a>

      will be accepted. Otherwise, the request will be rejected.


      Font embedding is an essential part of standard PDF workflows. Fonts
      should be embedded automatically by

      PDF editing software that are compliant with PDF standards.

      To make the API as explorable as possible, accounts have test and live

      environment API keys. You're not charged any fees in the test environment,

      so we encourage you to use it to try out services, perform quality

      assurance, and run automated testing. Objects―addresses, letters, checks,

      etc―in one environment cannot be manipulated by objects in the other.


      In general, a payment method (either credit card or ACH account) must be

      added to your account to make live API requests. However, a payment method

      is not required for the first 300 live requests per month to the

      `/v1/us_verifications` endpoint. After the first 300 requests, you will

      begin receiving errors with status code `403`.


      Requests made in the test environment always validate request arguments,

      simulate live environment behavior, and enforce rate limits. _They never

      print, mail nor, for verification services, verify addresses._ The US &

      International verification services trigger behavior with specific

      argument values, and, if you plan on using those, we recommend reading

      [US Verification Test Environment](#tag/US-Verifications-Test-Environment)

      and [Intl Verification Test
      Environment](#tag/Intl-Verifications-Test-Environment).


      To switch between environments, use the appropriate key for that

      environment when performing a request. You can find each environment's API

      key in your dashboard under Settings; test API keys are always prefixed

      with `test_` and production API keys with `live_`.

      As mailpieces travel through the mail stream, USPS scans their unique
      barcodes, and Lob processes these mail scans to generate tracking events.


      <h3>Certified Tracking Event Details</h3>


      Letters sent with USPS Certified Mail are fully tracked by USPS, and

      therefore their [tracking events](#operation/tracking_event) have an

      additional `details` object with more detailed information about the

      tracking event. The following table shows the potential values for

      the fields in the `details` object mapped to the tracking event `name`.

      ### API Versioning


      When backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new dated
      version

      is released. The latest version of the API is version **2024-01-01**. 

      All versions prior to, and inclusive of, 2019-02-11 have been sunsetted.
      You can

      view your version and upgrade to the latest version in your

      <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/settings/api-keys"
      target="_blank">Dashboard Settings</a>. You will

      only need to specify a version if you would like to test a newer version
      of

      the API without doing a full upgrade. The API will return an error if a

      version older than your current one is passed in.


      ### Example Request


      ```bash
        curl https://api.lob.com/v1/addresses \
          -u test_0dc8d51e0acffcb1880e0f19c79b2f5b0cc: \
          -H "Lob-Version: 2024-01-01"
      ```


      ### Specification Versioning

      You might be wondering why our API and specification use different
      versioning schemes.

      Lob's API predates our specification and follows the <a
      href="https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning" target="_blank">Stripe
      versioning</a>

      approach. This works well to manage backwards-incompatible changes to our
      API.


      For our API specification (used to create this documentation), we've
      chosen <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">semantic

      versioning</a>. This versioning reflects the backward-compatible

      changes that do not require a versioning of Lob's API.


      Lob's API specification will be used to generate artifacts like
      documentation, client SDKs,

      and other developer tooling. Semantic versioning of our specification will
      inform how we

      version those artifacts like SDKs. It is helpful to know the version of a
      specification

      used to produce an artifact in order reference the specification release
      notes.

      Webhooks are an easy way to get notifications on events happening
      asynchronously

      within Lob's architecture. For example, when a postcard gets a "Processed
      For

      Delivery" tracking event, an event object of type
      `postcard.processed_for_delivery`

      will be created. If you are subscribed to that event type in that
      Environment

      (Test vs. Live), Lob will send that event to any URLs you've specified via
      an

      HTTP POST request. In Live mode, you can only have as many webhooks as
      allotted

      in your current <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions"
      target="_blank">Print & Mail Edition</a>.

      There is no limit in Test mode.

      You can view and create <a href="https://dashboard.lob.com/#/webhooks"
      target="_blank">webhooks</a> on the

      Lob Dashboard, as well as view your <a
      href="https://dashboard.lob.com/#/events" target="_blank">events</a>.

      See our <a
      href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/getting-data-and-results/using-webhooks"
      target="_blank">Webhooks Integration Guide</a> for more

      details on how to integrate. Please see the full list of event types
      available for

      subscription here.

        Verify a US or US territory address _with a live API key_. The address
        can be in components (e.g. `primary_line` is "210 King Street",
        `zip_code` is "94107") or as a single string (e.g. "210 King Street
        94107"), but not as both. Requests using a test API key validate
        required fields but return empty values unless specific `primary_line`
        values are provided. See the [US Verifications Test
        Environment](#section/US-Verifications-Test-Env) for details.

            Box"), respectively. Only affects `recipient`, `primary_line`,
            `secondary_line`, `urbanization`, and `last_line`. Default casing is

                  * `In Transit` - The mailpiece is being processed at the entry/origin facility.

                  * `In Local Area` - The mailpiece is being processed at the destination facility.

                  * `Processed for Delivery` - The mailpiece has been greenlit for
                    delivery at the recipient's nearest postal facility. The mailpiece
                    should reach the mailbox within 1 business day of this tracking
                    event.

                  * `Delivered` - The mail piece has been delivered to 
                    the recipient’s address. The final scan is generated when the mail 
                    carrier's GPS unit leaves the delivery area.

                  * `Re-Routed` - The mailpiece is re-routed due to recipient change of
                    address, address errors, or USPS relabeling of barcode/ID tag
                    area.

                  * `Returned to Sender` - The mailpiece is being returned to sender due
                    to barcode, ID tag area, or address errors.
                  
                  * `International Exit` - The mail piece has been processed to 
                    ship to a destination abroad. This is typically the last 
                    scan a US-originated international mail piece will receive 
                    from the USPS.
