      This resource represents workflow schemes. Use it to manage workflow
      schemes and the workflow scheme's workflows and issue types.


      A workflow scheme maps issue types to workflows. A workflow scheme can be
      associated with one or more projects, which enables the projects to use
      the workflow-issue type mappings.


      Active workflow schemes (workflow schemes that are used by projects)
      cannot be edited. When an active workflow scheme is edited, a draft copy
      of the scheme is created. The draft workflow scheme is then be edited and
      published (replacing the active scheme).


      See [Configuring workflow
      schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/tohKLg) for more information.

      security levels can be applied to issues in that project. Sub-tasks also
      inherit the security level of their parent issue.

       *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
          
           *  `CurrentAssignee`
           *  `Reporter`
           *  `CurrentUser`

      ### About issue security schemes ###


      Issue security schemes control which users or groups of users can view an
      issue. An issue security scheme is made up of multiple security levels.
      Each level can have users or groups of users assigned to it. The following
      are valid security level members:

       *  Individual users
       *  Groups of users
       *  Project roles
       *  Issue roles
       *  "Anyone", for example to allow anonymous access
       *  A (multi-)user or (multi-)group picker custom field

        returns the metadata for the attachment's contents.

        A dashboard item enables an app to add user-specific information to a
        user dashboard. Dashboard items are exposed to users as gadgets that
        users can add to their dashboards. For more information on how users do
        this, see [Adding and customizing
        gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).


        When an app creates a dashboard item it registers a callback to receive
        the dashboard item ID. The callback fires whenever the item is rendered
        or, where the item is configurable, the user edits the item. The app
        then uses this resource to store the item's content or configuration
        details. For more information on working with dashboard items, see

            The check to perform:

             *  `syntax` Each expression's syntax is checked to ensure the expression can be parsed. Also, syntactic limits are validated. For example, the expression's length.
             *  `type` EXPERIMENTAL. Each expression is type checked and the final type of the expression inferred. Any type errors that would result in the expression failure at runtime are reported. For example, accessing properties that don't exist or passing the wrong number of arguments to functions. Also performs the syntax check.
             *  `complexity` EXPERIMENTAL. Determines the formulae for how many [expensive operations](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#expensive-operations) each expression may execute.

        Evaluates a Jira expression and returns its value.


        This resource can be used to test Jira expressions that you plan to use
        elsewhere, or to fetch data in a flexible way. Consult the [Jira
        expressions
        documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/)
        for more details.


        #### Context variables ####


        The following context variables are available to Jira expressions
        evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends on various factors;
        usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in
        the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain
        conditions.

         *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
         *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
         *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
         *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
         *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
         *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
         *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
         *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
         *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.

        Also, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their
        types. Those variables can be accessed by key in the Jira expression.
        These variable types are available for use in a custom context:

         *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.
         *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.
         *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.
         *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.

        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) required**: None.
        However, an expression may return different results for different users
        depending on their permissions. For example, different users may see
        different comments on the same issue.  

        Permission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software
        context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example,
        `issue.sprint`).

            `meta.complexity` that returns information about the expression
            complexity. For example, the number of expensive operations used by
            the expression and how close the expression is to reaching the
            [complexity
            limit](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions).
            Useful when designing and debugging your expressions.

        A custom field context without any issue types applies to all issue
        types. Adding issue types to such a custom field context would result in
        it applying to only the listed issue types.


        If any of the issue types exists in the custom field context, the
        operation fails and no issue types are added.

        A custom field context without any projects applies to all projects.
        Removing all projects from a custom field context would result in it
        applying to all projects.


        If any project in the request is not assigned to the context, or the
        operation would result in two global contexts for the field, the
        operation fails.

        This operation can only update field configurations used in
        company-managed (classic) projects.


        The operation can set the renderer for text fields to the default text
        renderer (`text-renderer`) or wiki style renderer (`wiki-renderer`).
        However, the renderer cannot be updated for fields using the
        autocomplete renderer (`autocomplete-renderer`).

        Returns a list of groups whose names contain a query string. A list of
        group names can be provided to exclude groups from the results.


        The primary use case for this resource is to populate a group picker
        suggestions list. To this end, the returned object includes the `html`
        field where the matched query term is highlighted in the group name with
        the HTML strong tag. Also, the groups list is wrapped in a response
        object that contains a header for use in the picker, specifically
        *Showing X of Y matching groups*.


        The list returns with the groups sorted. If no groups match the list
        criteria, an empty list is returned.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.

        Returns a list of users and groups matching a string. The string is
        used:

         *  for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required.
         *  for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name.

        For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the display name
        *Tina*, email address *sarah@tinplatetraining.com*, and the group
        *accounting* would be returned.


        Optionally, the search can be refined to:

         *  the projects and issue types associated with a custom field, such as a user picker. The search can then be further refined to return only users and groups that have permission to view specific:
            
             *  projects.
             *  issue types.
            
            If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.
         *  not return Connect app users and groups.
         *  return groups that have a case-insensitive match with the query.

        The primary use case for this resource is to populate a picker field
        suggestion list with users or groups. To this end, the returned object
        includes an `html` field for each list. This field highlights the
        matched query term in the item name with the HTML strong tag. Also, each
        list is wrapped in a response object that contains a header for use in a
        picker, specifically *Showing X of Y matching groups*.

        Creates an issue or, where the option to create subtasks is enabled in
        Jira, a subtask. A transition may be applied, to move the issue or
        subtask to a workflow step other than the default start step, and issue
        properties set.


        The content of the issue or subtask is defined using `update` and
        `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are
        determined using the [Get create issue
        metadata](https://dac-static.atlassian.com). These are the same fields
        that appear on the issue's create screen. Note that the `description`,
        `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text
        fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom
        fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document
        Format content.


        Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

         *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [Get create issue metadata](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) to find subtask issue types).
         *  `parent` must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

        In a next-gen project any issue may be made a child providing that the
        parent and child are members of the same project.

        Creates upto **50** issues and, where the option to create subtasks is
        enabled in Jira, subtasks. Transitions may be applied, to move the
        issues or subtasks to a workflow step other than the default start step,
        and issue properties set.


        The content of each issue or subtask is defined using `update` and
        `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are
        determined using the [Get create issue
        metadata](https://dac-static.atlassian.com). These are the same fields
        that appear on the issues' create screens. Note that the `description`,
        `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text
        fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom
        fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document
        Format content.


        Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

         *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [Get create issue metadata](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) to find subtask issue types).
         *  `parent` the must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

        **[Permissions](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) required:** *Browse
        projects* and *Create issues* [project
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project
        in which each issue or subtask is created.

        Sets a property value on multiple issues.


        The value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira
        expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/).
        Expressions must be computable with constant complexity when applied to
        a set of issues. Expressions must also comply with the
        [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions)
        that apply to all Jira expressions.


        The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.


        The filter identifies issues eligible for update using these criteria:

         *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
         *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.
         *  `hasProperty`:
            
             *  If *true*, only issues with the property are eligible.
             *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.

        If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical
        *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are eligible.


        If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned.
        For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false*
        would not match any issues (because without the property the property
        cannot have a value).


        The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues visible to the
        user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES permission for the issue
        are considered eligible.


        This operation is:

         *  transactional, either all eligible issues are updated or, when errors occur, none are updated.

        The issue is identified by its ID or key, however, if the identifier
        doesn't match an issue, a case-insensitive search and check for moved

        Edits an issue. Issue properties may be updated as part of the edit.
        Please note that issue transition will be ignored as it is not supported
        yet.


        The edits to the issue's fields are defined using `update` and `fields`.
        The fields that can be edited are determined using [Get edit issue
        metadata](https://dac-static.atlassian.com).


        The parent field may be set by key or ID. For standard issue types, the
        parent may be removed by setting `update.parent.set.none` to *true*.
        Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type
        custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format
        content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and
        don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

        Adds one or more attachments to an issue. Attachments are posted as
        multipart/form-data ([RFC 1867](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt)).


        Note that:

         *  The request must have a `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` header, if not it is blocked. See [Special headers](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) for more information.
         *  The name of the multipart/form-data parameter that contains the attachments must be `file`.

        The following examples upload a file called *myfile.txt* to the issue
        *TEST-123*:


        #### curl ####

            curl --location --request POST 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/TEST-123/attachments'
             -u 'email@example.com:<api_token>'

        Tip: Use a client library. Many client libraries have classes for
        handling multipart POST operations. For example, in Java, the Apache
        HTTP Components library provides a
        [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html)
        class for multipart POST operations.

        Returns the edit screen fields for an issue that are visible to and
        editable by the user. Use the information to populate the requests in
        [Edit issue](https://dac-static.atlassian.com).


        This endpoint will check for these conditions:


        1.  Field is available on a field screen - through screen, screen
        scheme, issue type screen scheme, and issue type scheme configuration.
        `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this condition.

        2.  Field is visible in the [field
        configuration](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/change-a-field-configuration/).
        `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this condition.

        3.  Field is shown on the issue: each field has different conditions
        here. For example: Attachment field only shows if attachments are
        enabled. Assignee only shows if user has permissions to assign the
        issue.

        4.  If a field is custom then it must have valid custom field context,
        applicable for its project and issue type. All system fields are assumed
        to have context in all projects and all issue types.

        5.  Issue has a project, issue type, and status defined.

        6.  Issue is assigned to a valid workflow, and the current status has
        assigned a workflow step. `overrideEditableFlag=true` skips this
        condition.

        7.  The current workflow step is editable. This is true by default, but
        [can be disabled by
        setting](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
        the `jira.issue.editable` property to `false`.
        `overrideEditableFlag=true` skips this condition.

        8.  User has [Edit issues
        permission](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/).

        9.  Workflow permissions allow editing a field. This is true by default
        but [can be
        modified](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
        using `jira.permission.*` workflow properties.


        Fields hidden using [Issue layout settings
        page](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/configure-field-layout-in-the-issue-view/)
        remain editable.

        permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg), can return
        additional details using:

         *  `overrideScreenSecurity` When this flag is `true`, then this endpoint skips checking if fields are available through screens, and field configuration (conditions 1. and 2. from the list above).
         *  `overrideEditableFlag` When this flag is `true`, then this endpoint skips checking if workflow is present and if the current step is editable (conditions 6. and 7. from the list above).

        This operation can be accessed anonymously.

        Loads an avatar for the issue type.


        Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request.
        Also, include the following headers:

         *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](https://dac-static.atlassian.com).
         *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

        For example:  

        `curl --request POST \ --user email@example.com:<api_token> \ --header
        'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' \ --header 'Content-Type: image/<
        image_type>' \ --data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" \ --url
        'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issuetype/{issueTypeId}'This`


        The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified,
        the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the
        square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the
        image.


        The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32,
        and 48x48 in size.


        After creating the avatar, use [Update issue
        type](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) to set it as the issue type's
        displayed avatar.

        This operation can filter the custom fields returned by project. Invalid

        returned.


        It can also return the collapsed field for custom fields. Collapsed
        fields enable searches to be performed across all fields with the same
        name and of the same field type. For example, the collapsed field
        `Component - Component[Dropdown]` enables dropdown fields `Component -
        cf[10061]` and `Component - cf[10062]` to be searched simultaneously.

        Sanitizes one or more JQL queries by converting readable details into
        IDs where a user doesn't have permission to view the entity.


        For example, if the query contains the clause *project = 'Secret
        project'*, and a user does not have browse permission for the project
        "Secret project", the sanitized query replaces the clause with *project
        = 12345"* (where 12345 is the ID of the project). If a user has the
        required permission, the clause is not sanitized. If the account ID is
        null, sanitizing is performed for an anonymous user.


        Note that sanitization doesn't make the queries GDPR-compliant, because
        it doesn't remove user identifiers (username or user key). If you need
        to make queries GDPR-compliant, use [Convert user identifiers to account
        IDs in JQL
        queries](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-jql/#api-rest-api-3-jql-sanitize-post).


        Before sanitization each JQL query is parsed. The queries are returned
        in the same order that they were passed.

         *  for a comment, where the user has both the permission to browse the comment and the project permission for the comment's parent issue. Only the BROWSE\_PROJECTS permission is supported. If a `commentId` is provided whose `permissions` does not equal BROWSE\_PROJECTS, a 400 error will be returned.

        This means that users may be shown as having an issue permission (such
        as EDIT\_ISSUES) in the global context or a project context but may not
        have the permission for any or all issues. For example, if Reporters
        have the EDIT\_ISSUES permission a user would be shown as having this
        permission in the global context or the context of a project, because
        any user can be a reporter. However, if they are not the user who
        reported the issue queried they would not have EDIT\_ISSUES permission
        for that issue.


        Global permissions are unaffected by context.

        ### About permission schemes and grants ###


        A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission
        grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.


        #### Holder object ####


        The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being
        granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects*
        permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*.
        In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the
        group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"` and the value
        is group ID, `"value": "ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f"`.


        The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

         *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
         *  `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.
         *  `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter`

        The following `types` are available. The expected values for `parameter`
        and `value` are given in parentheses (some types may not have a
        `parameter` or `value`):

         *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
         *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.
         *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
         *  `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID).
         *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).
         *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
         *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID).
         *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
         *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
         *  `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID).
         *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).

        #### Built-in permissions ####


        The [built-in Jira
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed
        below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project
        permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/)
        and [global
        permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/)

        Updates a permission scheme. Below are some important things to note
        when using this resource:

         *  If a permissions list is present in the request, then it is set in the permission scheme, overwriting *all existing* grants.
         *  If you want to update only the name and description, then do not send a permissions list in the request.
         *  Sending an empty list will remove all permission grants from the permission scheme.

        If you want to add or delete a permission grant instead of updating the
        whole list, see [Create permission
        grant](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) or [Delete permission scheme
        entity](https://dac-static.atlassian.com).


        See [About permission schemes and
        grants](../api-group-permission-schemes/#about-permission-schemes-and-grants)

        Loads an avatar for a project.


        Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request.
        Also, include the following headers:

         *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](https://dac-static.atlassian.com).
         *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

        For example:  

        `curl --request POST `


        `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


        `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


        `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


        `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


        `--url
        'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/{projectIdOrKey}/avatar2'`


        The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified,
        the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the
        square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the
        image.


        The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32,
        and 48x48 in size.


        After creating the avatar use [Set project
        avatar](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) to set it as the project's
        displayed avatar.

        The issue type hierarchy for a project consists of:

         *  *Epic* at level 1 (optional).
         *  One or more issue types at level 0 such as *Story*, *Task*, or *Bug*. Where the issue type *Epic* is defined, these issue types are used to break down the content of an epic.
         *  *Subtask* at level -1 (optional). This issue type enables level 0 issue types to be broken down into components. Issues based on a level -1 issue type must have a parent issue.

        ### About project roles ###


        [Project
        roles](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/)
        are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In
        Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all
        projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated
        with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all
        Jira applications).


        Project roles are used in [permission
        schemes](https://dac-static.atlassian.com), [email notification
        schemes](https://dac-static.atlassian.com), [issue security
        levels](https://dac-static.atlassian.com), [comment
        visibility](https://dac-static.atlassian.com), and workflow conditions.


        #### Members and actors ####


        In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*.
        An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.


        Actors may be set as [default
        members](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role)
        of the project role or set at the project level:

         *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
         *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

            subset of fields. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list.
            Expand options include:

             *  `*all` Returns all fields.
             *  `*navigable` Returns navigable fields.
             *  Any issue field, prefixed with a minus to exclude.

            Examples:

             *  `summary,comment` Returns only the summary and comments fields.
             *  `-description` Returns all navigable (default) fields except description.
             *  `*all,-comment` Returns all fields except comments.

            This parameter may be specified multiple times. For example,
            `fields=field1,field2&fields=field3`.


            Note: All navigable fields are returned by default. This differs
            from [GET issue](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) where the default
            is all fields.

             *  `renderedFields` Returns field values rendered in HTML format.
             *  `names` Returns the display name of each field.
             *  `schema` Returns the schema describing a field type.

             *  `operations` Returns all possible operations for the issue.
             *  `editmeta` Returns information about how each field can be edited.
             *  `changelog` Returns a list of recent updates to an issue, sorted by date, starting from the most recent.
             *  `versionedRepresentations` Instead of `fields`, returns `versionedRepresentations` a JSON array containing each version of a field's value, with the highest numbered item representing the most recent version.

        Use the [Search](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) endpoint if you need
        to fetch more than just issue IDs. The Search endpoint returns more
        information, but may take much longer to respond to requests. This is
        because it uses a different mechanism for ordering results than this
        endpoint and doesn't provide the total number of results for your query.

        The `columns` parameter accepts a navigable field value and is expressed
        as HTML form data. To specify multiple columns, pass multiple `columns`
        parameters. For example, in curl:


        `curl -X PUT -d columns=summary -d columns=description
        https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/settings/columns`


        If no column details are sent, then all default columns are removed.


        A navigable field is one that can be used as a column on the issue
        navigator. Find details of navigable issue columns using [Get
        fields](https://dac-static.atlassian.com).

        Loads a custom avatar for a project or issue type.


        Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request.
        Also, include the following headers:

         *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](https://dac-static.atlassian.com).
         *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

        For example:  

        `curl --request POST `


        `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


        `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


        `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


        `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


        `--url
        'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/universal_avatar/type/{type}/owner/{entityId}'`


        The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified,
        the square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the
        square's sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the
        image.


        The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32,
        and 48x48 in size.


        After creating the avatar use:

         *  [Update issue type](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) to set it as the issue type's displayed avatar.
         *  [Set project avatar](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) to set it as the project's displayed avatar.

        Returns a list of users that can be assigned to an issue. Use this
        operation to find the list of users who can be assigned to:

         *  a new issue, by providing the `projectKeyOrId`.
         *  an updated issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
         *  to an issue during a transition (workflow action), by providing the `issueKey` and the transition id in `actionDescriptorId`. You can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions` option in the `expand` parameter of [Get issue](https://dac-static.atlassian.com).

        In all these cases, you can pass an account ID to determine if a user
        can be assigned to an issue. The user is returned in the response if
        they can be assigned to the issue or issue transition.


        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
        `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
        from that range that can be assigned the issue. This means the operation
        usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all
        the users who can be assigned the issue, use [Get all
        users](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) and filter the records in your
        code.


        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
        preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address
        is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
        for more details.

        If no search string is provided, a list of all users with the
        permissions is returned.


        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
        `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
        from that range that match the search string and have permission for the
        project or issue. This means the operation usually returns fewer users
        than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the
        search string and have permission for the project or issue, use [Get all
        users](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) and filter the records in your
        code.


        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
        preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address
        is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
        for more details.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.

        Returns a list of users whose attributes match the query term. The
        returned object includes the `html` field where the matched query term
        is highlighted with the HTML strong tag. A list of account IDs can be
        provided to exclude users from the results.


        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `maxResults`, up
        to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range
        that match the query term. This means the operation usually returns
        fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who
        match the query term, use [Get all
        users](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) and filter the records in your
        code.


        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
        preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address
        is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
        for more details.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.

        Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria:

         *  their user attributes match a search string.
         *  they have permission to browse issues.

        Use this resource to find users who can browse:

         *  an issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
         *  any issue in a project, by providing the `projectKey`.

        This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
        `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
        from that range that match the search string and have permission to
        browse issues. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than
        specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the search
        string and have permission to browse issues, use [Get all
        users](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) and filter the records in your
        code.


        Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
        preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address
        is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
        for more details.


        This operation can be accessed anonymously.

        to create both team and company-managed scoped workflows.


        #### Conditions ####


        Conditions enable workflow rules that govern whether a transition can
        execute.


        ##### Always false condition #####


        A condition that always fails.

            {
               "type": "AlwaysFalseCondition"
             }

        ##### Block transition until approval #####


        A condition that blocks issue transition if there is a pending approval.

            {
               "type": "BlockInProgressApprovalCondition"
             }

        ##### Compare number custom field condition #####


        A condition that allows transition if a comparison between a number
        custom field and a value is true.

            {
               "type": "CompareNumberCFCondition",
               "configuration": {
                 "comparator": "=",
                 "fieldId": "customfield_10029",
                 "fieldValue": 2
               }
             }

         *  `comparator` One of the supported comparator: `=`, `>`, and `<`.
         *  `fieldId` The custom numeric field ID. Allowed field types:
            
             *  `com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.customfieldtypes:float`
             *  `com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:jsw-story-points`
         *  `fieldValue` The value for comparison.

        ##### Hide from user condition #####


        A condition that hides a transition from users. The transition can only
        be triggered from a workflow function or REST API operation.

            {
               "type": "RemoteOnlyCondition"
             }

        ##### Only assignee condition #####

        Get the list of workflow capabilities for a specific workflow using
        either the workflow ID, or the project and issue type ID pair. The
        response includes the scope of the workflow, defined as
        global/project-based, and a list of project types that the workflow is
        scoped to. It also includes all rules organised into their broad
        categories (conditions, validators, actions, triggers, screens) as well
        as the source location (Atlassian-provided, Connect, Forge).


        **[Permissions](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) required:**

         *  *Administer Jira* project permission to access all, including global-scoped, workflows
         *  *Administer projects* project permissions to access project-scoped workflows

        The current list of Atlassian-provided rules:


        #### Validators ####


        A validator rule that checks if a user has the required permissions to
        execute the transition in the workflow.


        ##### Permission validator #####


        A validator rule that checks if a user has the required permissions to
        execute the transition in the workflow.

            {
               "ruleKey": "system:check-permission-validator",
               "parameters": {

             }

        Parameters:

         *  `permissionKey` The permission required to perform the transition. Allowed values: [built-in Jira permissions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-permission-schemes/#built-in-permissions).

        ##### Parent or child blocking validator #####


        A validator to block the child issue\\u2019s transition depending on the
        parent issue\\u2019s status.

            {
               "ruleKey" : "system:parent-or-child-blocking-validator"
               "parameters" : {

                 "statusIds" : "1,2,3"
               }
             }

        Parameters:

         *  `blocker` currently only supports `PARENT`.
         *  `statusIds` a comma-separated list of status IDs.

        ##### Previous status validator #####


        A validator that checks if an issue has transitioned through specified
        previous status(es) before allowing the current transition to occur.

            {
               "ruleKey": "system:previous-status-validator",
               "parameters": {

         *  `previousStatusIds` a comma-separated list of status IDs, currently only support one ID.
         *  `mostRecentStatusOnly` when `true` only considers the most recent status for the condition evaluation. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.

        ##### Validate a field value #####


        A validation that ensures a specific field's value meets the defined
        criteria before allowing an issue to transition in the workflow.


        Depending on the rule type, the result will vary:


        ###### Field required ######

            {
               "ruleKey": "system:validate-field-value",
               "parameters": {
                 "ruleType": "fieldRequired",

        ##### Proforma: Forms attached validator #####


        Validates that one or more forms are attached to the issue.

            {
               "ruleKey" : "system:proforma-forms-attached"
               "parameters" : {}

        Validates that all forms attached to the issue have been submitted.

            {
               "ruleKey" : "system:proforma-forms-submitted"
               "parameters" : {}
             }

        #### Conditions ####


        Conditions enable workflow rules that govern whether a transition can
        execute.


        ##### Check field value #####


        A condition rule evaluates as true if a specific field's value meets the
        defined criteria. This rule ensures that an issue can only transition to
        the next step in the workflow if the field's value matches the desired
        condition.

            {
               "ruleKey": "system:check-field-value",
               "parameters": {
                 "fieldId": "description",
                 "fieldValue": "[\"Done\"]",
                 "comparator": "=",
                 "comparisonType": "STRING"
               }
             }

        Parameters:

         *  `fieldId` The ID of the field to check the value of. For non-system fields, it will look like `customfield_123`. Note: `fieldId` is used interchangeably with the idea of `fieldKey` here, they refer to the same field.
         *  `fieldValue` the list of values to check against the field\\u2019s value.
         *  `comparator` The comparison logic. Allowed values: `>`, `>=`, `=`, `<=`, `<`, `!=`.
         *  `comparisonType` The type of data being compared. Allowed values: `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `DATE`, `DATE_WITHOUT_TIME`, `OPTIONID`.

        ##### Restrict issue transition #####


        This rule ensures that issue transitions are restricted based on user
        accounts, roles, group memberships, and permissions, maintaining control
        over who can transition an issue. This condition evaluates as `true` if
        any of the following criteria is met.

            {
               "ruleKey": "system:restrict-issue-transition",
               "parameters": {
                 "accountIds": "allow-reporter,5e68ac137d64450d01a77fa0",
                 "roleIds": "10002,10004",
                 "groupIds": "703ff44a-7dc8-4f4b-9aa6-a65bf3574fa4",
                 "permissionKeys": "ADMINISTER_PROJECTS",
                 "groupCustomFields": "customfield_10028",
                 "allowUserCustomFields": "customfield_10072,customfield_10144,customfield_10007",
                 "denyUserCustomFields": "customfield_10107"
               }
             }

        Parameters:

         *  `accountIds` a comma-separated list of the user account IDs. It also allows generic values like: `allow-assignee`, `allow-reporter`, and `accountIds` Note: This is only supported in team-managed projects
         *  `roleIds` a comma-separated list of role IDs.
         *  `groupIds` a comma-separated list of group IDs.
         *  `permissionKeys` a comma-separated list of permission keys. Allowed values: [built-in Jira permissions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-permission-schemes/#built-in-permissions).
         *  `groupCustomFields` a comma-separated list of group custom field IDs.
         *  `allowUserCustomFields` a comma-separated list of user custom field IDs to allow for issue transition.
         *  `denyUserCustomFields` a comma-separated list of user custom field IDs to deny for issue transition.

        This rule is composed by aggregating the following legacy rules:

         *  AllowOnlyAssignee
         *  AllowOnlyReporter
         *  InAnyProjectRoleCondition
         *  InProjectRoleCondition
         *  UserInAnyGroupCondition
         *  UserInGroupCondition
         *  PermissionCondtion
         *  InGroupCFCondition
         *  UserIsInCustomFieldCondition

        ##### Previous status condition #####


        A condition that evaluates based on an issue's previous status(es) and
        specific criteria.

            {
               "ruleKey" : "system:previous-status-condition"
               "parameters" : {
                 "previousStatusIds" : "10004",

               }
             }

        Parameters:

         *  `previousStatusIds` a comma-separated list of status IDs, current only support one ID.
         *  `not` indicates if the condition should be reversed. When `true` it checks that the issue has not been in the selected statuses. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
         *  `mostRecentStatusOnly` when true only considers the most recent status for the condition evaluation. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
         *  `includeCurrentStatus` includes the current status when evaluating if the issue has been through the selected statuses. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
         *  `ignoreLoopTransitions` ignore loop transitions. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.

        ##### Parent or child blocking condition #####


        A condition to block the parent\\u2019s issue transition depending on
        the child\\u2019s issue status.

        Returns a list of the workflow schemes associated with a list of
        projects. Each returned workflow scheme includes a list of the requested
        projects associated with it. Any team-managed or non-existent projects
        in the request are ignored and no errors are returned.


        If the project is associated with the `Default Workflow Scheme` no ID is
        returned. This is because the way the `Default Workflow Scheme` is
        stored means it has no ID.

        Sets the default workflow for a workflow scheme.


        Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the workflow
        scheme is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true` in the request
        object and a draft workflow scheme is created or updated with the new
        default workflow. The draft workflow scheme can be published in Jira.

            *com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.customfieldtypes:grouppickersearcher*.  

            The search UI (basic search and JQL search) will display different
            operations and values for the field, based on the field searcher.
            You must specify a searcher that is valid for the field type, as
            listed below (abbreviated values shown):

             *  `cascadingselect`: `cascadingselectsearcher`
             *  `datepicker`: `daterange`
             *  `datetime`: `datetimerange`
             *  `float`: `exactnumber` or `numberrange`
             *  `grouppicker`: `grouppickersearcher`
             *  `importid`: `exactnumber` or `numberrange`
             *  `labels`: `labelsearcher`
             *  `multicheckboxes`: `multiselectsearcher`
             *  `multigrouppicker`: `multiselectsearcher`
             *  `multiselect`: `multiselectsearcher`
             *  `multiuserpicker`: `userpickergroupsearcher`
             *  `multiversion`: `versionsearcher`
             *  `project`: `projectsearcher`
             *  `radiobuttons`: `multiselectsearcher`
             *  `readonlyfield`: `textsearcher`
             *  `select`: `multiselectsearcher`
             *  `textarea`: `textsearcher`
             *  `textfield`: `textsearcher`
             *  `url`: `exacttextsearcher`
             *  `userpicker`: `userpickergroupsearcher`
             *  `version`: `versionsearcher`

            If no searcher is provided, the field isn't searchable. However,
            [Forge custom
            fields](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/#jira-custom-field-type--beta-)
            have a searcher set automatically, so are always searchable.

            Use [expand](em>#expansion) to include additional information about
            issues in the response. Note that, unlike the majority of instances
            where `expand` is specified, `expand` is defined as a list of
            values. The expand options are:

             *  `renderedFields` Returns field values rendered in HTML format.
             *  `names` Returns the display name of each field.
             *  `schema` Returns the schema describing a field type.
             *  `transitions` Returns all possible transitions for the issue.
             *  `operations` Returns all possible operations for the issue.
             *  `editmeta` Returns information about how each field can be edited.
             *  `changelog` Returns a list of recent updates to an issue, sorted by date, starting from the most recent.
             *  `versionedRepresentations` Instead of `fields`, returns `versionedRepresentations` a JSON array containing each version of a field's value, with the highest numbered item representing the most recent version.

        fields:
          description: >-
            A list of fields to return for each issue, use it to retrieve a
            subset of fields. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list.
            Expand options include:

             *  `*all` Returns all fields.
             *  `*navigable` Returns navigable fields.
             *  Any issue field, prefixed with a minus to exclude.

            The default is `*navigable`.


            Examples:

             *  `summary,comment` Returns the summary and comments fields only.
             *  `-description` Returns all navigable (default) fields except description.
             *  `*all,-comment` Returns all fields except comments.

            Multiple `fields` parameters can be included in a request.


            Note: All navigable fields are returned by default. This differs
            from [GET issue](https://dac-static.atlassian.com) where the default
            is all fields.

             *  Update an inactive workflow scheme with `updateDraftIfNeeded` set to `true`: The workflow scheme is updated, as inactive workflow schemes do not require drafts to update.

            Defaults to `false`.

    - title: About
      anchor: about
      body: >-
        The Jira REST API enables you to interact with Jira programmatically.
        Use this API to 

        [build
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/integrating-with-jira-cloud/),
        script interactions with 

        Jira, or develop any other type of integration. This page documents the
        REST resources available in Jira Cloud, including 

        the HTTP response codes and example requests and responses.
    - title: Version
      anchor: version
      body: >
        This documentation is for **version 3** of the Jira Cloud platform REST
        API, which is the latest version

        but is in **beta**. [Version
        2](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/) and 

        version 3 of the API offer the same collection of operations. However,
        version 3 provides support for 

        the [Atlassian Document
        Format](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/) 

        (ADF) in: 

        - `body` in comments, including where comments are used in issue, issue
        link, and transition resources.

        - `comment` in worklogs.

        - `description` and `environment` fields in issues.

        - `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) in issues.
        Single line custom fields 
          (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

        However, these new features are under development and may change.
    - title: Authentication and authorization
      anchor: authentication
      body: >
        ### Forge apps


        For Forge apps, [REST API
        scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) 

        are used when authenticating with Jira Cloud platform. See [Add scopes
        to call an Atlassian REST
        API](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/add-scopes-to-call-an-atlassian-rest-api/)
        for more details.


        The URIs for Forge app REST API calls have this structure:


        `/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Connect apps


        For Connect apps, authentication (JWT-based) is built into the Connect
        libraries. Authorization is implemented using either 

        scopes (shown as _App scope required_ for operations on this page) or
        user impersonation. See 

        [Security for Connect
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/) 

        for details.


        The URIs for Connect app REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Other integrations


        For integrations that are not Forge or Connect apps, use OAuth 2.0
        authorization code grants (3LO) for security 

        (3LO scopes are shown as for operations _OAuth scopes required_). See 

        [OAuth 2.0 (3LO)
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) 

        for details.


        The URIs for OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example,
        `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/35273b54-3f06-40d2-880f-dd28cf8daafa/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Ad-hoc API calls


        For personal scripts, bots, and ad-hoc execution of the REST APIs use
        basic authentication. See [Basic auth for REST
        APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)
        for details. 


        The URIs for basic authentication REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`
    - title: Permissions
      anchor: permissions
      body: >
        ### Operation permissions


        Most operations in this API require permissions. The calling user must
        have the required permissions for an operation to 

        use it. Note that for Connect apps, the app user must have the required
        permissions for the operation and the app must 

        have scopes that permit the operation.


        A permission can be granted to a group, project role, or issue role that
        the user is a member of, or granted directly to a user. 

        See [Permissions overview](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ)
        for details. The most common permissions are:


        - **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_ group have
        this 

        permission. See [Manage
        groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.

        - **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_ global
        permission. There is a default group for this permission. 

        See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and
        [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)
        for details.

        - **Administer a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Administer projects_
        project permission for a project. This can be 

        granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

        See [Managing project
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.

        - **Access a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Browse projects_ project
        permission for a project. This can be 

        granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

        See [Managing project
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.

        - **Access Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Users_ global permission. Users
        in the default product access group (for example, 

        _jira-software-users-acmesite_) have this permission. 

        See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and 

        [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)
        for details.


        ### Anonymous access


        Some operations provide support for anonymous access. However, anonymous
        access is only available if 

        the Jira permission needed to access the object or records returned by
        the operation is granted to 

        the _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your
        project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) 

        for details.


        If an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is not
        available, the operation will return 

        an error. Note that not all operations that correspond to objects that
        can be given public access 

        provide for anonymous access.
    - title: Expansion, pagination, and ordering
      anchor: expansion
      body: >+
        ### Expansion


        The Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that some parts
        of a resource are not returned unless specified 

        in the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.


        To expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand query
        parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. 

        If you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot notation. If you
        need to expand multiple objects, use a 

        comma-separated list. 


        For example, the following request expands the `names` and
        `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:


        `GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`


        To discover which object can be expanded, refer to the `expand` property
        in the object. 

        In the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as
        expandable.


        ```json

        {
          "expand": "widgets", 
          "self": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1", 
          "widgets": {
            "widgets": [],
            "size": 5
           }
        }

        ```


        ### Pagination


        The Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is
        enforced for operations that could return a large 

        collection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource,
        the response wraps the returned array of values in 

        a JSON object with paging metadata. For example:


        ```json

        {
            "startAt" : 0,
            "maxResults" : 10,
            "total": 200,
            "isLast": false,
            "values": [
                { /* result 0 */ },
                { /* result 1 */ },
                { /* result 2 */ }
            ]
        }

        ```


        *   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the page.

        *   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page can return.
        Each operation can have a different limit for
            the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items 
            that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.
        *    `total` is the total number of items contained in all pages. This
        number **_may change_** as the client 

        requests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should always assume
        that the requested page can be empty. Note 

        that this property is not returned for all operations.

        *   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last one. Note
        that this property is not returned for all operations.


        ### Ordering


        Some operations support ordering the elements of a response by a field.
        Check the documentation for the operation to 

        confirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which fields can
        be used. Responses are listed in ascending order 

        by default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query parameter
        with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:


        *   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.

        *   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.

        *   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.


    - title: Timestamps
      anchor: timestamps
      body: >
        By default, top-level timestamps (e.g. updated and created) are returned
        in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) format, in the system
        default user time zone.


        To return date time data in the logged in user's timezone, please refer
        to `renderedFields` property under the `expand` query parameter in
        relevant APIs.
    - title: Special headers
      anchor: special-request-headers
      body: >-
        The following request and response headers define important metadata for
        the Jira Cloud REST API resources.


        -   `X-Atlassian-Token` (request): Operations that accept
        multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check`

        header in requests. Otherwise the request is blocked by cross-site
        request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection.

        -   `X-Force-Accept-Language` (request): controls how the standard HTTP
        `Accept-Language` header is processed.

        By default `Accept-Language` is ignored and the response is in the
        language configured in the user's profile or,

        when no language is configured for the user, the default Jira instance
        language. For the response to recognize

        `Accept-Language` send `X-Force-Accept-Language = true` as well. If
        `Accept-Language` requests a language that Jira

        can return the response is in that language, otherwise Jira returns the
        response in the default language. If

        `Accept-Language` is not specified the response is in the default
        language.

        -   `X-AAccountId` (response): This response header contains the
        Atlassian account ID of the authenticated user.
    - title: Anonymous operations
      anchor: anonymous-operations
      body: |2-
         Jira provides for all permissions, except the [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) Administer Jira, to be assigned to *Anyone*. Once a permission is assigned to *Anyone*, anyone knowing a project's URL is able to use the features in Jira enabled by the permission. However, the Jira REST API does not enable anonymous access for operations by default. This means that an anonymous user who may be able to perform an action through Jira, may not be able to perform the same action where it's enabled by the REST API. 

         The operations that provide anonymous access are annotated "This operation can be accessed anonymously."
    - title: Asynchronous operations
      anchor: async-operations
      body: >-
        Some Jira REST API operations may trigger long-running or
        computationally expensive tasks. In these cases, the operation 

        will schedule an asynchronous task and return a `303 (See Other)`
        response, indicating the location of the queued task 

        in the `Location` header. You can query this task to get progress
        updates.


        When the task finishes, the response object will contain the `result`
        field. The content of the field is specific to the 

        operation that created the task. Refer to the operation’s documentation
        for more information.


        Note that asynchronous tasks are not guaranteed to be run in order. In
        other words, if you need your tasks to execute 

        in a certain order, you should start a task only after the prerequisite
        task(s) have finished.
    - title: Experimental features
      anchor: experimental
      body: >
        Features and methods marked as experimental may change without notice.
        Feedback on experimental functionality is welcome. 

        Report your suggestions and bugs in the [ACJIRA
        project](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/projects/ACJIRA) (preferred) or
        use the 

        **Give docs feedback** link at the top of this page. 
    - title: Status codes
      anchor: status-codes
      body: >-
        The Jira Cloud platform REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
        codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


        Operations that return an error status code may also return a response
        body containing details of the error or errors. 

        The schema for the response body is shown below:



        ```json

        {
          "id": "https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/schema/error-collection#",
          "title": "Error Collection",
          "type": "object",

              }
            },
            "errors": {
              "type": "object",
              "patternProperties": {
                ".+": {
                  "type": "string"
                }
              },
              "additionalProperties": false
            },
            "status": { 
              "type": "integer"
            }
          },
          "additionalProperties": false
        }

        ```
