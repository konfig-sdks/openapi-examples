    Welcome to Paycor's Public API! This document is a reference for the APIs
    Paycor has available, and acts as a complement to the "Guides" section. 


    # Getting Started


    <strong>To learn more about getting started with Paycor's Public APIs, check
    out our <a href="/guides">Guides.</a></strong>


    # GET, PUT, POST


    * When requesting object, use GET endpoints. All list endpoints support
    paging, as described [in the other doc]. 

    * When creating an object, use POST endpoints. Your code will need to create
    an object and send it to Paycor in your API call request body as JSON. You
    can use the "request sample" body as a starting point. Our endpoints will
    return a reference to the created object (the ID and GET API URL) for your
    system.

    * When updating an object, you will use PUT endpoints. The general flow
    would be to: GET the object you want to update, modify the fields as
    desired, then PUT the object (as JSON in the request body) to our endpoints.
    Some fields like the object's ID cannot be updated because they are
    system-set.'



    # Error Handling


    * 400: Please consult the response text to correct your request
    information. 

    * 401 with response "Access denied due to missing subscription key": Please
    include your APIM Subscription Key as header Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key or
    querystring parameter subscription-key. 

    * 401 with no response: Please ensure you included a valid & current Access
    Token in the Authorization header.

    * 403: Please ensure your Access Token's scope has all the relevant access
    you need, on the AppCreator Data Access screen. 

    * 404: Please validate the API route you are using. If that is correct, one
    of your IDs most likely does not exist or is not in a valid state. 

    * 429: Paycor implements rate limits for our Public API. Each customer
    (implemented via APIM subscription key) has a limited number of calls. The
    number of calls is counted across all APIs, not per individual API. Please
    use bulk endpoints where available and spread your calls over a wider
    timespan.
      * The default rate limit is up to 1000 API calls per minute (total across all our Public APIs). 
    * 500: Please contact Paycor. When you make a POST or PUT call and receive a
    500, please do not retry the call automatically - this may result in
    double-posting. GETs can be safely retried.



    # IDs


    * ClientId = LegalEntityId

    * TenantId = CompanyId

    * EmployeeId is not visible in Paycor's UI, you must retrieve it from the
    Public API


    # Earnings, Deductions, Taxes


    This section describes the domain model for Paycor's Earnings, Deductions,
    and Taxes. This will provide background for many paydata-related Public API
    endpoints. 


    Paycor stores Earnings, Deductions, and Taxes each at three levels:

    * Global: Same data across all legal entities. Setup by Paycor for customers
    to choose from. Sample Codes (note these will not be setup on every Legal
    Entity):
      * Earnings: REG, OT
      * Taxes: FITWH, SOC, SOCER, OHCIN
      * Deductions: 401k, KMat, H125, UWay
    * Legal Entity or Tenant: Codes setup &amp; customized on the legal entity
    or Tenant level. Must be tied to a Global Code. 
      * Perform UI allows creating Deduction and Earning codes on Tenant level (under Configure Company nav menu). These will be returned by the Legal Entity Public API endpoints. 
    * Employee: codes setup on a particular employee, tied to a Legal
    Entity-level or Tenant-level code
      * Employee Earnings/Deductions/Taxes are applied during payroll. Many properties are inherited from the Legal Entity or Global levels, but some can be overridden.

      These endpoints interact with Employees.

      * An Employee is linked to a single Legal Entity, a single Person, and a
      single Tenant.

      * Each Person will be linked to one or more Employees (setup by the admin
      in the Manage People screen).

      * Employee APIs will return Work email addresses, not Home.

  - description: "\r\nEmployees can setup Direct Deposit accounts to send their paycheck into bank accounts or HSA accounts. \r\n* To use the Employee Direct Deposit endpoints, the Legal Entity must have the Direct Deposit Workflow product or an error will be returned\r\n* Employees can choose a 'partial' or a 'full' (called Net) Direct Deposit. Partial Direct Deposits must set either a Rate or an Amount.\r\n* All Direct Deposits and HSA Direct Deposits must be tied to a Deduction Code that has already been setup on the Legal Entity.\r\n  * To add a new DD, you'll need to call 'GET Legal Entity Deductions' and find a Deduction Code of the correct type - usually one with DD or HSA in the Code.\r\n"

        * Tip: first list the Paygroups within a Legal Entity using GET Legal
        Entity Pay Groups, in order to populate the payGroupId parameter

        * Tip: You can take the returned Check Dates or Process Dates and pass
        into Get Employee Pay Stubs by EmployeeID


        Note that query parameters PayGroupId, AsOfDate and UntilDate are
        required.

          description: >-
            IsTransfer property serves as an indicator in identifying a transfer
            punch.

            When set to 'true' this property designates a punch as a transfer
            punch.

            To appropriately handle a transfer punch ensure that the
            'PunchStatusType' is set to value 'Transfer' when sending a payload.

            If 'PunchStatusType' is set to a value other then 'Transfer' and
            'IsTransfer' is set to 'true', PunchStatusType value will get
            ignored in most of the cases.

            Transfer punch is essential for tracking and management of employee
            transfers during the working hours.

            Transfer punches find their use in scenarios where an employee
            undergoes a change in department or labor type.

            By adding a transfer punch the application effectively captures
            these transitions

            providing an overview of employee movements between different
            departments or labor types.
