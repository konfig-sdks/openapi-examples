    # Overview


    ## Authentication


    LaunchDarkly's REST API uses the HTTPS protocol with a minimum TLS version
    of 1.2.


    All REST API resources are authenticated with either [personal or service
    access
    tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens),
    or session cookies. Other authentication mechanisms are not supported. You
    can manage personal access tokens on your [**Account
    settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.


    LaunchDarkly also has SDK keys, mobile keys, and client-side IDs that are
    used by our server-side SDKs, mobile SDKs, and JavaScript-based SDKs,
    respectively. **These keys cannot be used to access our REST API**. These
    keys are environment-specific, and can only perform read-only operations
    such as fetching feature flag settings.

    > #### Keep your access tokens and SDK keys private

    >

    > Access tokens should _never_ be exposed in untrusted contexts. Never put
    an access token in client-side JavaScript, or embed it in a mobile
    application. LaunchDarkly has special mobile keys that you can embed in
    mobile apps. If you accidentally expose an access token or SDK key, you can
    reset it from your [**Account
    settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.

    >

    > The client-side ID is safe to embed in untrusted contexts. It's designed
    for use in client-side JavaScript.


    ### Authentication using request header


    The preferred way to authenticate with the API is by adding an
    `Authorization` header containing your access token to your requests. The
    value of the `Authorization` header must be your access token.


    Manage personal access tokens from the [**Account
    settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.


    ### Authentication using session cookie


    For testing purposes, you can make API calls directly from your web browser.
    If you are logged in to the LaunchDarkly application, the API will use your
    existing session to authenticate calls.


    If you have a [role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/built-in-roles)
    other than Admin, or have a [custom
    role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/custom-roles) defined, you may
    not have permission to perform some API calls. You will receive a `401`
    response code in that case.


    > ### Modifying the Origin header causes an error

    >

    > LaunchDarkly validates that the Origin header for any API request
    authenticated by a session cookie matches the expected Origin header. The
    expected Origin header is `https://app.launchdarkly.com`.

    >

    > If the Origin header does not match what's expected, LaunchDarkly returns
    an error. This error can prevent the LaunchDarkly app from working
    correctly.

    >

    > Any browser extension that intentionally changes the Origin header can
    cause this problem. For example, the `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` Chrome
    extension changes the Origin header to `http://evil.com` and causes the app
    to fail.

    >

    > To prevent this error, do not modify your Origin header.

    >

    > LaunchDarkly does not require origin matching when authenticating with an
    access token, so this issue does not affect normal API usage.


    ## Representations


    All resources expect and return JSON response bodies. Error responses also
    send a JSON body. To learn more about the error format of the API, read
    [Errors](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


    In practice this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type`
    header set to `application/json`.


    In addition, request bodies for `PATCH`, `POST`, and `PUT` requests must be
    encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.


    ### Summary and detailed representations


    When you fetch a list of resources, the response includes only the most
    important attributes of each resource. This is a _summary representation_ of
    the resource. When you fetch an individual resource, such as a single
    feature flag, you receive a _detailed representation_ of the resource.


    The best way to find a detailed representation is to follow links. Every
    summary representation includes a link to its detailed representation.


    ### Expanding responses


    Sometimes the detailed representation of a resource does not include all of
    the attributes of the resource by default. If this is the case, the request
    method will clearly document this and describe which attributes you can
    include in an expanded response.


    To include the additional attributes, append the `expand` request parameter
    to your request and add a comma-separated list of the attributes to include.
    For example, when you append `?expand=members,roles` to the [Get
    team](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) endpoint, the expanded response
    includes both of these attributes.


    ### Links and addressability


    The best way to navigate the API is by following links. These are attributes
    in representations that link to other resources. The API always uses the
    same format for links:


    - Links to other resources within the API are encapsulated in a `_links`
    object

    - If the resource has a corresponding link to HTML content on the site, it
    is stored in a special `_site` link


    Each link has two attributes:


    - An `href`, which contains the URL

    - A `type`, which describes the content type


    For example, a feature resource might return the following:


    ```json

    {
      "_links": {
        "parent": {
          "href": "/api/features",
          "type": "application/json"
        },
        "self": {
          "href": "/api/features/sort.order",
          "type": "application/json"
        }
      },
      "_site": {
        "href": "/features/sort.order",
        "type": "text/html"
      }
    }

    ```


    From this, you can navigate to the parent collection of features by
    following the `parent` link, or navigate to the site page for the feature by
    following the `_site` link.


    Collections are always represented as a JSON object with an `items`
    attribute containing an array of representations. Like all other
    representations, collections have `_links` defined at the top level.


    Paginated collections include `first`, `last`, `next`, and `prev` links
    containing a URL with the respective set of elements in the collection.


    ## Updates


    Resources that accept partial updates use the `PATCH` verb. Most resources
    support the [JSON patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) format. Some
    resources also support the [JSON merge
    patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) format, and some resources support
    the [semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) format, which is a
    way to specify the modifications to perform as a set of executable
    instructions. Each resource supports optional
    [comments](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) that you can submit with
    updates. Comments appear in outgoing webhooks, the audit log, and other
    integrations.


    When a resource supports both JSON patch and semantic patch, we document
    both in the request method. However, the specific request body fields and
    descriptions included in our documentation only match one type of patch or
    the other.


    ### Updates using JSON patch


    [JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) is a way to
    specify the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON patch uses paths
    and a limited set of operations to describe how to transform the current
    state of the resource into a new state. JSON patch documents are always
    arrays, where each element contains an operation, a path to the field to
    update, and the new value.


    For example, in this feature flag representation:


    ```json

    {
        "name": "New recommendations engine",
        "key": "engine.enable",
        "description": "This is the description",
        ...
    }

    ```

    You can change the feature flag's description with the following patch
    document:


    ```json

    [{ "op": "replace", "path": "/description", "value": "This is the new
    description" }]

    ```


    You can specify multiple modifications to perform in a single request. You
    can also test that certain preconditions are met before applying the patch:


    ```json

    [
      { "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 10 },
      { "op": "replace", "path": "/description", "value": "The new description" }
    ]

    ```


    The above patch request tests whether the feature flag's `version` is `10`,
    and if so, changes the feature flag's description.


    Attributes that are not editable, such as a resource's `_links`, have names
    that start with an underscore.


    ### Updates using JSON merge patch


    [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) is another
    format for specifying the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON merge
    patch is less expressive than JSON patch. However, in many cases it is
    simpler to construct a merge patch document. For example, you can change a
    feature flag's description with the following merge patch document:


    ```json

    {
      "description": "New flag description"
    }

    ```


    ### Updates using semantic patch


    Some resources support the semantic patch format. A semantic patch is a way
    to specify the modifications to perform on a resource as a set of executable
    instructions.


    Semantic patch allows you to be explicit about intent using precise, custom
    instructions. In many cases, you can define semantic patch instructions
    independently of the current state of the resource. This can be useful when
    defining a change that may be applied at a future date.


    To make a semantic patch request, you must append
    `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.


    Here's how:


    ```

    Content-Type: application/json; domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch

    ```


    If you call a semantic patch resource without this header, you will receive
    a `400` response because your semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON
    patch.


    The body of a semantic patch request takes the following properties:


    * `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.

    * `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some resources only) The
    environment key.

    * `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should
    perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property
    that indicates the instruction. If the instruction requires parameters, you
    must include those parameters as additional fields in the object. The
    documentation for each resource that supports semantic patch includes the
    available instructions and any additional parameters.


    For example:


    ```json

    {
      "comment": "optional comment",
      "instructions": [ {"kind": "turnFlagOn"} ]
    }

    ```


    If any instruction in the patch encounters an error, the endpoint returns an
    error and will not change the resource. In general, each instruction
    silently does nothing if the resource is already in the state you request.


    ### Updates with comments


    You can submit optional comments with `PATCH` changes.


    To submit a comment along with a JSON patch document, use the following
    format:


    ```json

    {
      "comment": "This is a comment string",
      "patch": [{ "op": "replace", "path": "/description", "value": "The new description" }]
    }

    ```


    To submit a comment along with a JSON merge patch document, use the
    following format:


    ```json

    {
      "comment": "This is a comment string",
      "merge": { "description": "New flag description" }
    }

    ```


    To submit a comment along with a semantic patch, use the following format:


    ```json

    {
      "comment": "This is a comment string",
      "instructions": [ {"kind": "turnFlagOn"} ]
    }

    ```


    ## Errors


    The API always returns errors in a common format. Here's an example:


    ```json

    {
      "code": "invalid_request",
      "message": "A feature with that key already exists",
      "id": "30ce6058-87da-11e4-b116-123b93f75cba"
    }

    ```


    The `code` indicates the general class of error. The `message` is a
    human-readable explanation of what went wrong. The `id` is a unique
    identifier. Use it when you're working with LaunchDarkly Support to debug a
    problem with a specific API call.


    ### HTTP status error response codes


    | Code | Definition        |
    Description                                                                                      
    | Possible Solution                                                |

    | ---- | ----------------- |
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

    | 400  | Invalid request       | The request cannot be
    understood.                                    | Ensure JSON syntax in
    request body is correct.                   |

    | 401  | Invalid access token      | Requestor is unauthorized or does not
    have permission for this API
    call.                                                | Ensure your API
    access token is valid and has the appropriate
    permissions.                                     |

    | 403  | Forbidden         | Requestor does not have access to this
    resource.                                                | Ensure that the
    account member or access token has proper permissions set. |

    | 404  | Invalid resource identifier | The requested resource is not valid.
    | Ensure that the resource is correctly identified by ID or key. |

    | 405  | Method not allowed | The request method is not allowed on this
    resource. | Ensure that the HTTP verb is correct. |

    | 409  | Conflict          | The API request can not be completed because it
    conflicts with a concurrent API request. | Retry your
    request.                                              |

    | 422  | Unprocessable entity | The API request can not be completed because
    the update description can not be understood. | Ensure that the request body
    is correct for the type of patch you are using, either JSON patch or
    semantic patch.

    | 429  | Too many requests | Read [Rate
    limiting](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).                                              
    | Wait and try again later.                                        |


    ## CORS


    The LaunchDarkly API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX
    requests from any origin. If an `Origin` header is given in a request, it
    will be echoed as an explicitly allowed origin. Otherwise the request
    returns a wildcard, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. For more information
    on CORS, read the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors).
    Example CORS headers might look like:


    ```http

    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length,
    Accept-Encoding, Authorization

    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH

    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

    Access-Control-Max-Age: 300

    ```


    You can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin
    calls, using either [token or session-based
    authentication](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com). If you are using session
    authentication, you should set the `withCredentials` property for your `xhr`
    request to `true`. You should never expose your access tokens to untrusted
    entities.


    ## Rate limiting


    We use several rate limiting strategies to ensure the availability of our
    APIs. Rate-limited calls to our APIs return a `429` status code. Calls to
    our APIs include headers indicating the current rate limit status. The
    specific headers returned depend on the API route being called. The limits
    differ based on the route, authentication mechanism, and other factors.
    Routes that are not rate limited may not contain any of the headers
    described below.


    > ### Rate limiting and SDKs

    >

    > LaunchDarkly SDKs are never rate limited and do not use the API endpoints
    defined here. LaunchDarkly uses a different set of approaches, including
    streaming/server-sent events and a global CDN, to ensure availability to the
    routes used by LaunchDarkly SDKs.


    ### Global rate limits


    Authenticated requests are subject to a global limit. This is the maximum
    number of calls that your account can make to the API per ten seconds. All
    service and personal access tokens on the account share this limit, so
    exceeding the limit with one access token will impact other tokens. Calls
    that are subject to global rate limits may return the headers below:


    | Header name                    |
    Description                                                                     
    |

    | ------------------------------ |
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |

    | `X-Ratelimit-Global-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests the
    account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |

    | `X-Ratelimit-Reset`            | The time at which the current rate limit
    window resets in epoch milliseconds.    |


    We do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be made
    globally. This limit may change, and we encourage clients to program against
    the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than
    hardcoding to the current limit.


    ### Route-level rate limits


    Some authenticated routes have custom rate limits. These also reset every
    ten seconds. Any service or personal access tokens hitting the same route
    share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token may impact
    other tokens. Calls that are subject to route-level rate limits return the
    headers below:


    | Header name                   |
    Description                                                                                          
    |

    | ----------------------------- |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |

    | `X-Ratelimit-Route-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests to the
    current route the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |

    | `X-Ratelimit-Reset`           | The time at which the current rate limit
    window resets in epoch milliseconds.                         |


    A _route_ represents a specific URL pattern and verb. For example, the
    [Delete environment](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) endpoint is
    considered a single route, and each call to delete an environment counts
    against your route-level rate limit for that route.


    We do not publicly document the specific number of calls that an account can
    make to each endpoint per ten seconds. These limits may change, and we
    encourage clients to program against the specification, relying on the two
    headers defined above, rather than hardcoding to the current limits.


    ### IP-based rate limiting


    We also employ IP-based rate limiting on some API routes. If you hit an
    IP-based rate limit, your API response will include a `Retry-After` header
    indicating how long to wait before re-trying the call. Clients must wait at
    least `Retry-After` seconds before making additional calls to our API, and
    should employ jitter and backoff strategies to avoid triggering rate limits
    again.


    ## OpenAPI (Swagger) and client libraries


    We have a [complete OpenAPI (Swagger)
    specification](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/openapi.json) for our
    API.


    We auto-generate multiple client libraries based on our OpenAPI
    specification. To learn more, visit the [collection of client libraries on
    GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-api+org%3Alaunchdarkly&type=Repositories).
    You can also use this specification to generate client libraries to interact
    with our REST API in your language of choice.


    Our OpenAPI specification is supported by several API-based tools such as
    Postman and Insomnia. In many cases, you can directly import our
    specification to explore our APIs.


    ## Method overriding


    Some firewalls and HTTP clients restrict the use of verbs other than `GET`
    and `POST`. In those environments, our API endpoints that use `DELETE`,
    `PATCH`, and `PUT` verbs are inaccessible.


    To avoid this issue, our API supports the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header,
    allowing clients to "tunnel" `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests using a
    `POST` request.


    For example, to call a `PATCH` endpoint using a `POST` request, you can
    include `X-HTTP-Method-Override:PATCH` as a header.


    ## Beta resources


    We sometimes release new API resources in **beta** status before we release
    them with general availability.


    Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development.
    They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.


    We try to promote resources into general availability as quickly as
    possible. This happens after sufficient testing and when we're satisfied
    that we no longer need to make backwards-incompatible changes.


    We mark beta resources with a "Beta" callout in our documentation, pictured
    below:


    > ### This feature is in beta

    >

    > To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key
    with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more,
    read [Beta resources](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

    To use a beta resource, you must include a header in the request. If you
    call a beta resource without this header, you receive a `403` response.


    Use this header:


    ```

    LD-API-Version: beta

    ```


    ## Federal environments


    The version of LaunchDarkly that is available on domains controlled by the
    United States government is different from the version of LaunchDarkly
    available to the general public. If you are an employee or contractor for a
    United States federal agency and use LaunchDarkly in your work, you likely
    use the federal instance of LaunchDarkly.


    If you are working in the federal instance of LaunchDarkly, the base URI for
    each request is `https://app.launchdarkly.us`. In the "Try it" sandbox for
    each request, click the request path to view the complete resource path for
    the federal environment.

    environments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/advanced/federal).


    ## Versioning


    We try hard to keep our REST API backwards compatible, but we occasionally
    have to make backwards-incompatible changes in the process of shipping new
    features. These breaking changes can cause unexpected behavior if you don't
    prepare for them accordingly.


    Updates to our REST API include support for the latest features in
    LaunchDarkly. We also release a new version of our REST API every time we
    make a breaking change. We provide simultaneous support for multiple API
    versions so you can migrate from your current API version to a new version
    at your own pace.


    ### Setting the API version per request


    You can set the API version on a specific request by sending an
    `LD-API-Version` header, as shown in the example below:


    ```

    LD-API-Version: 20240415

    ```


    The header value is the version number of the API version you would like to
    request. The number for each version corresponds to the date the version was
    released in `yyyymmdd` format. In the example above the version `20240415`
    corresponds to April 15, 2024.


    ### Setting the API version per access token


    When you create an access token, you must specify a specific version of the
    API to use. This ensures that integrations using this token cannot be broken
    by version changes.


    Tokens created before versioning was released have their version set to
    `20160426`, which is the version of the API that existed before the current
    versioning scheme, so that they continue working the same way they did
    before versioning.


    If you would like to upgrade your integration to use a new API version, you
    can explicitly set the header described above.


    > ### Best practice: Set the header for every client or integration

    >

    > We recommend that you set the API version header explicitly in any client
    or integration you build.

    >

    > Only rely on the access token API version during manual testing.

      The feature flags API allows you to list, create, modify, and delete
      feature flags, their statuses, and their expiring targets
      programmatically. For example, you can control percentage rollouts, target
      specific contexts, or even toggle off a feature flag programmatically.


      ## Sample feature flag representation


      Every feature flag has a set of top-level attributes, as well as an
      `environments` map containing the flag rollout and targeting rules
      specific to each environment. To learn more, read [Using feature
      flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/creating-flags).

      ## Anatomy of a feature flag


      This section describes the sample feature flag representation in more
      detail.


      ### Top-level attributes


      Most of the top-level attributes have a straightforward interpretation,
      for example `name` and `description`.


      The `variations` array represents the different variation values that a
      feature flag has. For a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and
      `false`. Multivariate flags have more variation values, and those values
      could be any JSON type: numbers, strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting
      rules, the variations are referred to by their index into this array.


      To update these attributes, read [Update feature
      flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com), especially the instructions for
      **updating flag settings**.


      ### Per-environment configurations


      Each entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object that
      represents the environment-specific flag configuration data available in
      the flag's Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Targeting with
      flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags).


      To update per-environment information for a flag, read [Update feature
      flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com), especially the instructions for
      **turning flags on and off** and **working with targeting and
      variations**.


      ### Individual context targets


      The `targets` and `contextTargets` arrays in the per-environment
      configuration data correspond to the individual context targeting on the
      Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Individual
      targeting](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/individual-targeting).


      Each object in the `targets` and `contextTargets` arrays represents a list
      of context keys assigned to a particular variation. The `targets` array
      includes contexts with `contextKind` of "user" and the `contextTargets`
      array includes contexts with context kinds other than "user."


      For example:


      ```json

      {
        ...
        "environments" : {
          "production" : {
            ...
            "targets": [
              {
                "values": ["user-key-123abc"],
                "variation": 0,
                "contextKind": "user"
              }
            ],
            "contextTargets": [
              {
                "values": ["org-key-123abc"],
                "variation": 0,
                "contextKind": "organization"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }

      ```


      The `targets` array means that any user context instance with the key
      `user-key-123abc` receives the first variation listed in the `variations`
      array. The `contextTargets` array means that any organization context with
      the key `org-key-123abc` receives the first variation listed in the
      `variations` array. Recall that the variations are stored at the top level
      of the flag JSON in an array, and the per-environment configuration rules
      point to indexes into this array. If this is a boolean flag, both contexts
      are receiving the `true` variation.


      ### Targeting rules


      The `rules` array corresponds to the rules section of the Targeting tab.
      This is where you can express complex rules on attributes with conditions
      and operators. For example, you might create a rule that specifies "roll
      out the `true` variation to 80% of contexts whose email address ends with
      `gmail.com`". To learn more, read [Creating targeting
      rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/targeting-rules#creating-targeting-rules).


      ### The fallthrough rule


      The `fallthrough` object is a special rule that contains no conditions. It
      is the rollout strategy that is applied when none of the individual or
      custom targeting rules match. In the LaunchDarkly UI, it is called the
      "Default rule."


      ### The off variation


      The off variation represents the variation to serve if the feature flag
      targeting is turned off, meaning the `on` attribute is `false`. For
      boolean flags, this is usually `false`. For multivariate flags, set the
      off variation to whatever variation represents the control or baseline
      behavior for your application. If you don't set the off variation,
      LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.


      ### Percentage rollouts


      When you work with targeting rules and with the default rule, you can
      specify either a single variation or a percentage rollout. The `weight`
      attribute defines the percentage rollout for each variation. Weights range
      from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout). The weights are scaled
      by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can be represented
      without using floating-point. For example, a weight of `60000` means that
      60% of contexts will receive that variation. The sum of weights across all
      variations should be 100%.

      > ### Synced segments and larger list-based segments are an Enterprise
      feature

      >

      > This section documents endpoints for rule-based, list-based, and synced
      segments.

      >

      > A "big segment" is a segment that is either a synced segment, or a
      list-based segment with more than 15,000 entries that includes only one
      targeted context kind. LaunchDarkly uses different implementations for
      different types of segments so that all of your segments have good
      performance.

      >

      > In the segments API, a big segment is indicated by the `unbounded` field
      being set to `true`.

      >

      > These segments are available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To
      learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/).
      To upgrade your plan, [contact
      Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).


      Segments are groups of contexts that you can use to manage flag targeting
      behavior in bulk. LaunchDarkly supports:


      * rule-based segments, which let you target groups of contexts

      You can create an approval request that prevents a flag change from being
      applied without approval from a team member. Select up to ten members as
      reviewers. Reviewers receive an email notification, but anyone with
      sufficient permissions can review a pending approval request. A change
      needs at least one approval before you can apply it. To learn more, read
      [Approvals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/approvals).


      Changes that conflict will fail if approved and applied, and the flag will
      not be updated.


      Several of the endpoints in the approvals API require a flag approval
      request ID. The flag approval request ID is returned as part of the
      [Create approval request](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [List
      approval requests for a flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses.
      It is the `_id` field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items`
      array. If you created the approval request as part of a
      [workflow](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com), you can also use a workflow
      ID as the approval request ID. The workflow ID is returned as part of the
      [Create workflow](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Get
      workflows](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses. It is the `_id`
      field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.

      >

      > Code references is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To
      learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/).
      To upgrade your plan, [contact
      Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).


      > ### Use ld-find-code-refs

      >

      > LaunchDarkly provides the [ld-find-code-refs
      utility](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs) that creates
      repository connections, generates code reference data, and creates calls
      to the code references API. Most customers do not need to call this API
      directly.


      The code references API provides access to all resources related to each
      connected repository, and associated feature flag code reference data for
      all branches. To learn more, read [Code
      references](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/code/code-references).

      > ### This feature is in beta

      >

      > To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key
      with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more,
      read [Beta resources](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).

      >

      > Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development.
      They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.


      The account usage API lets you query for metrics about how your account is
      using LaunchDarkly. To learn more, read [Account usage
      metrics](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/billing/usage-metrics).


      Each endpoint returns time-series data in the form of an array of data
      points with timestamps. Each one contains data for that time from one or
      more series. It also includes a metadata array describing what each of the
      series is.
    name: Account usage (beta)
  - description: >

      Contexts are people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter
      feature flags in your product. Contexts are identified by their `kind`,
      which describes the type of resources encountering flags, and by their
      `key`. Each unique combination of one or more contexts that have
      encountered a feature flag in your product is called a context instance.


      When you use the LaunchDarkly SDK to evaluate a flag, you provide a
      context to that call. LaunchDarkly records the key and attributes of each
      context instance. You can view these in the LaunchDarkly user interface
      from the **Contexts** list, or use the Context APIs. To learn more, read
      [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).


      LaunchDarkly provides APIs for you to:


      * retrieve contexts, context instances, and context attribute names and
      values

      * search for contexts or context instances

      * delete context instances

      * fetch context kinds

      * create and update context kinds


      To learn more about context kinds, read [Context
      kinds](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts/context-kinds).


      Contexts are always scoped within a project and an environment. Each
      environment has its own set of context instance records.


      Several of the endpoints in the contexts API require a context instance ID
      or application ID. Both of these IDs are returned as part of the [Search
      for context instances](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) response. The
      context instance ID is the `id` field of each element in the `items`
      array. The application ID is the `applicationId` field of each element in
      the `items` array. By default, the application ID is set to the SDK you
      are using. In the LaunchDarkly UI, the application ID and application
      version appear on the context details page in the "From source" field. You
      can change the application ID as part of your SDK configuration. To learn
      more, read [Application metadata
      configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/app-config).


      ### Filtering contexts and context instances


      When you [search for contexts](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) or
      [context instances](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com), you can filter on
      certain fields using the `filter` parameter either as a query parameter or
      as a request body parameter.


      The `filter` parameter supports the following operators: `after`, `anyOf`,
      `before`, `contains`, `equals`, `exists`, `notEquals`, `startsWith`.


      <details>

      <summary>Expand for details on operators and syntax</summary>


      #### after


      Returns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field,
      which should be dates, are after the provided time. For example:


      * `myField after "2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00"`


      #### anyOf


      Returns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field
      match any of the values in the match value. For example:


      * `myField anyOf [44]`

      * `myField anyOf ["phone","tablet"]`

      * `myField anyOf [true]"`


      #### before


      Returns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field,
      which should be dates, are before the provided time. For example:


      * `myField before "2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00"`


      #### contains


      Returns contexts or context instances if all the match values are found in
      the list of values in this field. For example:


      * `myListField contains 44`

      * `myListField contains ["phone","tablet"]`

      * `myListField contains true`


      #### equals


      Returns contexts or context instances if there is an exact match on the
      entire field. For example:


      * `myField equals 44`

      * `myField equals "device"`

      * `myField equals true`

      * `myField equals [1,2,3,4]`

      * `myField equals ["hello","goodbye"]`


      #### exists


      Returns contexts or context instances if the field matches the specified
      existence. For example:


      * `myField exists true`

      * `myField exists false`

      * `*.name exists true`


      #### notEquals


      Returns contexts or context instances if there is not an exact match on
      the entire field. For example:


      * `myField notEquals 44`

      * `myField notEquals "device"`

      * `myField notEquals true`

      * `myField notEquals [1,2,3,4]`

      * `myField notEquals ["hello","goodbye"]`


      #### startsWith


      Returns contexts or context instances if the value in a field, which
      should be a singular string, begins with the provided substring. For
      example:


      * `myField startsWith "do"`


      </details>


      You can also combine filters in the following ways:


      * Use a comma (`,`) as an AND operator

      * Use a vertical bar (`|`) as an OR operator

      * Use parentheses `()` to group filters


      For example:


      * `myField notEquals 0, myField notEquals 1` returns contexts or context
      instances where `myField` is not 0 and is not 1

      * `myFirstField equals "device",(mySecondField equals
      "iPhone"|mySecondField equals "iPad")` returns contexts or context
      instances where `myFirstField` is equal to "device" and `mySecondField` is
      equal to either "iPhone" or "iPad"


      #### Supported fields and operators


      You can only filter certain fields in contexts and context instances when
      using the `filter` parameter. Additionally, you can only filter some
      fields with certain operators.


      When you search for [contexts]((https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)), the
      `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators:


      |<div style="width:120px">Field</div> |Description |Supported operators |

      |---|---|---|

      |`applicationId` |An identifier representing the application where the
      LaunchDarkly SDK is running. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |

      |`id` |Unique identifier for the context. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`
      |

      |`key` |The context key. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |

      |`kind` |The context kind. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |

      |`kinds` |A list of all kinds found in the context. Supply a list of
      strings to the operator. |`equals`, `anyOf`, `contains` |

      |`kindKey` |The kind and key for the context. They are joined with `:`,
      for example, `user:user-key-abc123`. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |

      |`kindKeys` |A list of all kinds and keys found in the context. The kind
      and key are joined with `:`, for example, `user:user-key-abc123`. Supply a
      list of strings to the operator. |`equals`, `anyOf`, `contains` |

      |`q` |A "fuzzy" search across context attribute values and the context
      key. Supply a string or list of strings to the operator.  |`equals` |

      |`name` |The name for the context. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `exists`,
      `anyOf`, `startsWith` |

      |`<a kind>.<an attribute name>` |A kind and the name of any attribute that
      appears in a context of that kind, for example, `user.email`. To filter
      all kinds, use `*` in place of the kind, for example, `*.email`. You can
      use either a literal attribute name or a JSON path to specify the
      attribute. If you use a JSON path, then you must escape the `/` character,
      using `~1`, and the `~` character, using `~0`. For example, use
      `user.job/title` or `user./job~1title` to filter the `/job/title` field in
      a user context kind. If the field or value includes whitespace, it should
      be enclosed in double quotes. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `exists`,
      `startsWith`, `before`, `after`.|


      When searching for [context instances](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com),
      the `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators


      |<div style="width:120px">Field</div> |Description |Supported operators |

      |---|---|---|

      |`applicationId` |An identifier representing the application where the
      LaunchDarkly SDK is running. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |

      |`id` |Unique identifier for the context instance. |`equals`, `notEquals`,
      `anyOf` |

      |`kinds` |A list of all kinds found in the context instance. Supply a list
      of strings to the operator. |`equals`, `anyOf`, `contains` |

      |`kindKeys` |A list of all kinds and keys found in the context instance.
      The kind and key are joined with `:`, for example, `user:user-key-abc123`.
      Supply a list of strings to the operator. |`equals`, `anyOf`, `contains` |

      > To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key
      with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more,

      They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.


      Experimentation lets you validate the impact of features you roll out to
      your app or infrastructure. You can measure things like page views,
      clicks, load time, infrastructure costs, and more. By connecting metrics
      you create to flags in your LaunchDarkly environment, you can measure the
      changes in your customers' behavior based on what flags they evaluate. You
      can run experiments on boolean, string, and number flags, but not JSON
      flags. To learn more, read [About
      Experimentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/about-experimentation).


      You can manage experiments by using the dedicated experiment endpoints
      described below.


      Several of the endpoints require a treatment ID or a flag rule ID.
      Treatment IDs are returned as part of the [Get experiment
      results](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getExperimentResults)
      response. They are the `treatmentId` of each element in the
      `treatmentResults` array. Winning treatment IDs are also returned as part
      of the [Get
      experiment](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getExperiment)
      response. They are the `winningTreatmentId` in the `currentIteration`, the
      `winningTreatmentId` in the `draftIteration`, and the `winningTreatmentId`
      in each element of the `previousIterations` array. In the flags object,
      the rule ID is the ID of the variation or rollout of the flag. Each flag
      variation ID is returned as part of the [Get feature
      flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getFeatureFlag)
      response. It is the `_id` field in each element of the `variations` array.


      Customers on older contracts may have experiments created under an older
      data model. These experiments are listed in the LaunchDarkly user
      interface as "Legacy experiments." You can manage them by making PATCH
      requests to the flags API, and you can analyze them by making a GET
      request to the deprecated [Get legacy experiment
      results](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getLegacyExperimentResults)
      endpoint. To learn more about legacy experiments, read [Legacy
      experiments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/managing-experiments#legacy-experiments).


      <details>

      <summary>Click to expand details on using the PATCH requests to the flags
      API to manage legacy experiments</summary>


      ### Managing legacy experiments


      To manage legacy experiments, make the following PATCH requests to the
      flags API:


      #### Adding an experiment


      To add an experiment to a flag, add a new object to the
      `/experiments/items/` property.


      The object must contain:


      1. The key of the metric you want to use for the experiment.

      2. (Optional) A list of keys for the environments where the experiment
      should record data.


      ```json

      PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}

      [
          {
              "op": "add",
              "path": "/experiments/items/0",
              "value": {
                  "metricKey": "metric-key-123abc",
                  "environments": []
              }
          }
      ]

      ```


      #### Removing an experiment


      To remove an experiment, remove the corresponding item from the
      experiments or items property.


      ```json

      PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}

      [
          {
              "op": "remove",
              "path": "/experiments/items/0"
          }
      ]

      ```


      #### Starting or resuming an experiment


      To start recording data for an experiment in an environment, add the
      environment key to the list of environments for that experiment.


      ```json

      PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}

      [
          {
              "op": "add",
              "path": "/experiments/items/0/environments/0",
              "value": "production"
          }
      ]

      ```


      #### Stopping an experiment


      To stop collecting data for an experiment in a specific environment,
      remove the environment from the list that experiment uses.


      ```json

      PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}

      [
        {
          "op": "remove",
          "path": "/experiments/items/0/environments/0"
        }
      ]

      ```


      #### Updating the baseline


      To update the baseline for all experiments on a flag across all
      environments in the project, replace the `baselineIdx` property with the
      index of the new baseline variation.


      ```json

      PATCH /api/v2/flags/{projKey}/{flagKey}

      [
        {
          "op": "replace",
          "path": "/experiments/baselineIdx",
          "value": 1
        }
      ]

      ```

      all team members. To learn more, read
      [Teams](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/teams).


      The Teams API allows you to create, read, update, and delete a team.


      Several of the endpoints in the Teams API require one or more member IDs.
      The member ID is returned as part of the [List account

      The applications API lets you create, update, delete, and search for
      applications and application versions.


      Each application includes information about the app you're creating, and a
      set of versions of the app that you've released. You can use applications
      to target particular application versions in your feature flags more
      easily, and to handle unsupported application versions more gracefully.


      In addition to creating applications through the applications API, you can
      also create applications in the LaunchDarkly user interface. To learn
      more, read
      [Applications](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/organize/applications).
      LaunchDarkly also creates applications and application versions
      automatically when a LaunchDarkly SDK evaluates a feature flag for a
      context that includes application information. To learn more, read
      [Automatic environment
      attributes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/environment-attributes).


      You can use an application in any project in your LaunchDarkly account.


      ### Filtering applications and application versions


      The `filter` parameter supports the following operators: `equals`,
      `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith`.


      You can also combine filters in the following ways:


      - Use a comma (`,`) as an AND operator

      - Use a vertical bar (`|`) as an OR operator

      - Use parentheses (`()`) to group filters


      #### Supported fields and operators


      You can only filter certain fields in applications when using the `filter`
      parameter. Additionally, you can only filter some fields with certain
      operators.


      When you search for applications, the `filter` parameter supports the
      following fields and operators:


      |<div style="width:120px">Field</div> |Description |Supported operators |

      |---|---|---|

      |`key` | The application or application version key, a unique identifier
      |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |

      |`name` | The application name or application version name |`equals`,
      `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |

      |`autoAdded` | Whether the application or application version was
      automatically created because it was included in a context when a
      LaunchDarkly SDK evaluated a feature flag, or was created through the
      LaunchDarkly UI or REST API |`equals`, `notEquals` |

      |`kind` | The application kind, one of `mobile`, `server`, `browser`. Only
      available for [Get
      applications](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getApplications).
      |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |

      |`supported` | Whether a mobile application version is supported or
      unsupported. Only available for [Get application versions by application
      key](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getApplicationVersions).|`equals`,
      `notEquals` |


      For example, the filter `?filter=kind anyOf ['mobile', 'server']` matches
      applications whose `kind` is either `mobile` or `server`. The filter is
      not case-sensitive.


      The documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL
      encoding. For example, the `[` in `?filter=kind anyOf ['mobile',
      'server']` must be encoded to `%5B`.


      ### Sorting applications and application versions


      LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for sorting:

      - `name` sorts by application name.

      - `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the application.


      By default, the sort is in ascending order. Use `-` to sort in descending
      order. For example, `?sort=name` sorts the response by application name in
      ascending order, and `?sort=-name` sorts in descending order.

      You can use the integrations API to create, delete, and manage
      integrations between LaunchDarkly and third-party applications.


      Specifically, the integrations API provides endpoints for managing the
      persistent store integrations, also called "big segment" store
      integrations, that are required when you use a server-side SDK and big
      segments.


      > ### Synced segments and larger list-based segments are an Enterprise
      feature

      >

      > Segments synced from external tools and larger list-based segments with
      more than 15,000 entries are the two kinds of "big segment." LaunchDarkly
      uses different implementations for different types of segments so that all
      of your segments have good performance.

      >

      > These segments are available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To
      learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/).
      To upgrade your plan, [contact
      Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).


      [Segments synced from external
      tools](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments/synced-segments) and
      [larger list-based
      segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments/list-based-segments#larger-list-based-segments)
      are the two kinds of big segment. If you are using server-side SDKs, these
      segments require a persistent store within your infrastructure.
      LaunchDarkly keeps the persistent store up to date and consults it during
      flag evaluation.


      You need either a persistent store integration or a [Relay
      Proxy](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/relay-proxy) to support these
      segments. The integrations API lets you manage the persistent store
      integrations.


      To learn more about segments, read
      [Segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments) and [Segment
      configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments/big-segment-configuration).


      Several of the endpoints in the integrations API require an integration
      ID. The integration ID is returned as part of the [Create big segment
      store
      integration](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/createBigSegmentStoreIntegration)
      response, in the `_id` field. It is also returned as part of the [List all
      big segment store
      integrations](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getBigSegmentStoreIntegrations)
      response, in the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.


      You can find other APIs for working with big segments under
      [Segments](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Segments
      (beta)](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)).

      > If you want to import metric events into LaunchDarkly from an existing
      data source, use the metric import API. To learn more, read [Importing
      metric events](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


      > ### Metric keys and event keys are different

      >

      > LaunchDarkly automatically generates a metric key when you create a
      metric. You can use the metric key to identify the metric in API calls.

      >

      > Custom conversion/binary and custom numeric metrics also require an
      event key. You can set the event key to anything you want. Adding this
      event key to your codebase lets your SDK track actions customers take in
      your app as events. To learn more, read [Sending custom
      events](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/events).

      account members can log into your application with their LaunchDarkly
      account.


      You can create and manage LaunchDarkly OAuth clients using the
      LaunchDarkly OAuth client API. This API acknowledges creation of your
      client with a response containing a one-time, unique `_clientSecret`. If
      you lose your client secret, you will have to register a new client.
      LaunchDarkly does not store client secrets in plain text.


      Several of the endpoints in the OAuth2 client API require an OAuth client
      ID. The OAuth client ID is returned as part of the [Create a LaunchDarkly
      OAuth 2.0 client](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Get
      clients](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses. It is the
      `_clientId` field, or the `_clientId` field of each element in the `items`
      array.


      You must have _Admin_ privileges or an access token created by a member
      with _Admin_ privileges in order to be able to use this feature.


      Please note that `redirectUri`s must be absolute URIs that conform to the
      https URI scheme. If you wish to register a client with a different URI
      scheme, please contact LaunchDarkly Support.

      Release pipelines track the progression of a feature flag across a series
      of phases, where each phase consists of one or more environments. When you
      add a flag to a release pipeline, you create a "release" to track that
      flag's progress through the pipeline.


      You can use release pipelines to ensure that you correctly roll out the
      flag in each environment before moving on to the next. You can also use
      them to view the status of ongoing releases across all flags within a
      project, enforcing a standardized process and ensuring they are following
      best practices. To learn more, read [Release
      pipelines](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/release-pipelines).


      With the release pipelines API, you can view, create, and delete release
      pipelines.


      With the related [releases API](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)), you
      can view and update the active releases for a given flag.


      To add a feature flag to an existing release pipeline, use the [Update
      feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) endpoint.

      The webhooks API lets you build your own integrations that subscribe to
      activities in LaunchDarkly. When you generate an activity in LaunchDarkly,
      such as when you change a flag or you create a project, LaunchDarkly sends
      an HTTP POST payload to the webhook's URL. Use webhooks to update external
      issue trackers, update support tickets, notify customers of new feature
      rollouts, and more.


      Several of the endpoints in the webhooks API require a webhook ID. The
      webhook ID is returned as part of the [Creates a
      webhook](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [List
      webhooks](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) responses. It is the `_id`
      field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array.


      ## Designating the payload


      The webhook payload is identical to an audit log entry. To learn more,
      read [Get audit log entry](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


      Here's a sample payload:


      > ### Webhook delivery order

      >

      > Webhooks may not be delivered in chronological order. We recommend using
      the payload's "date" field as a timestamp to reorder webhooks as they are
      received.

          "name": "Testing",
          "resources": ["proj/alexis:env/test"]
        }
      }

      ```


      ## Signing the webhook


      Optionally, you can define a `secret` when you create a webhook. If you
      define the secret, the webhook `POST` request will include an
      `X-LD-Signature header`, whose value will contain an HMAC SHA256 hex
      digest of the webhook payload, using the `secret` as the key.


      Compute the signature of the payload using the same shared secret in your
      code to verify that the webhook was triggered by LaunchDarkly.


      ## Understanding connection retries


      If LaunchDarkly receives a non-`2xx` response to a webhook `POST`, it will
      retry the delivery one time. Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If you
      build an integration on webhooks, make sure it is tolerant of delivery
      failures.

      Flag links let you view external mentions of flags from other tools and
      services. Links to external conversations and references to your flags
      allow you to collaborate more easily and quickly review relevant flag
      contexts. To learn more, read [Flag
      links](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/organize/links).


      You can create custom flag links by associating an external URL with a
      feature flag. After you create a flag link, it applies across all your
      environments. You should use caution when you delete a flag link, because
      it will be deleted from all your environments.


      With the flag links API, you can view, create, update, and delete links to
      flags.


      Several of the endpoints in the flag links API require a flag link ID. The
      flag link ID is returned as part of the [Create flag

      The segments API allows you to create and retrieve exports and imports for
      big segments, which are synced segments or list-based segments with 15,000
      or more entries. To learn more, read
      [Segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments).


      Several of the endpoints in the segments API require an import or export
      ID. The import ID is returned in the `Location` header as part of the
      [Create big segment
      import](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/createBigSegmentImport)
      request. The export ID is returned in the `Location` header as part of the
      [Create big segment
      export](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/createBigSegmentExport)
      request. In each case, the ID is the final element of the path returned in
      the `Location` header.


      You can find other APIs for working with big segments under
      [Segments](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Integrations

      of these endpoints. To learn more, read
      [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).



      LaunchDarkly creates a record for each user passed in to `variation`
      calls. This record powers the autocomplete functionality on the feature
      flag dashboard, as well as the Users page. To learn more, read [Users and
      user segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/users).


      LaunchDarkly also offers an API that lets you tap into this data. You can
      use the users API to see what user data is available to LaunchDarkly, as
      well as determine which flag values a user will receive. You can also
      explicitly set which flag value a user will receive via this API.


      Users are always scoped within a project and environment. In other words,
      each environment has its own set of user records.

      A workflow is a set of actions that you can schedule in advance to make
      changes to a feature flag at a future date and time. You can also include
      approval requests at different stages of a workflow. To learn more, read
      [Workflows](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows).


      The actions supported are as follows:


      - Turning targeting `ON` or `OFF`

      - Setting the default variation

      - Adding targets to a given variation

      - Creating a rule to target by segment

      - Modifying the rollout percentage for rules


      You can create multiple stages of a flag release workflow. Unique stages
      are defined by their conditions: either approvals and/or scheduled
      changes.


      Several of the endpoints in the workflows API require a workflow ID or one
      or more member IDs. The workflow ID is returned as part of the [Create
      workflow](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) and [Get

      Workflow templates allow you to define a set of workflow stages that you
      can use as a starting point for new workflows. You can create these
      workflows for any flag in any environment and any project, and you can
      create as many workflows as you like from a given template.


      You can create workflow templates in two ways:

      * by specifying the desired stages, using the `stages` property of the
      request body

      * by specifying an existing workflow to save as a template, using the
      `workflowId` property of the request body


      You can use templates to create a workflow in any project, environment, or
      flag. However, when you create a template, you must specify a particular
      project, environment, and flag. This means that when you create a template
      using the `stages` property, you must also include `projectKey`,
      `environmentKey`, and `flagKey` properties in the request body. When you
      create a template from an existing workflow, it will use the project,
      environment, and flag of the existing workflow, so those properties can be
      omitted from the request body.


      To learn more, read [Workflows
      documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows)

      Tags are simple strings that you can attach to most resources in
      LaunchDarkly. Tags are useful for grouping resources into a set that you
      can name in a resource specifier. To learn more, read [Custom role
      concepts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/members/role-concepts#tags).


      Using the tags API, you can list existing tags for resources.

      > ### Teams is an Enterprise feature

      >

      > Teams is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more,
      [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade
      your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).


      A team is a group of members in your LaunchDarkly account. A team can have
      maintainers who are able to add and remove team members. It also can have
      custom roles assigned to it that allows shared access to those roles for
      all team members. To learn more, read
      [Teams](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/teams).

      > ### Contexts are now available

      >

      > After you have upgraded your LaunchDarkly SDK to use contexts instead of
      users, you should use [Contexts](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) instead
      of these endpoints. To learn more, read
      [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).

      LaunchDarkly creates a record for each user passed in to `variation`
      calls. This record powers the autocomplete functionality on the feature
      flag dashboard, as well as the Users page. To learn more, read [Users and
      user segments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/users)


      LaunchDarkly also offers an API that lets you access this data. You can
      use the users API to see what user data is available to LaunchDarkly, as
      well as determine which flag values a user will receive. You can also
      explicitly set which flag value a user will receive with this API.


      Users are always scoped within both a project and an environment. Each
      environment has its own set of user records.

        ### Expanding the applications response


        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the "Get applications" response to
        include additional fields.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include
        the following:


        * `flags` includes details on the flags that have been evaluated by the
        application


        For example, use `?expand=flags` to include the `flags` field in the
        response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.

        ### Expanding the application response


        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the "Get application" response to
        include additional fields.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include
        the following:


        * `flags` includes details on the flags that have been evaluated by the
        application


        For example, use `?expand=flags` to include the `flags` field in the
        response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.

        ### Filtering approvals


        LaunchDarkly supports the `filter` query param for filtering, with the
        following fields:


        - `notifyMemberIds` filters for only approvals that are assigned to a
        member in the specified list. For example: `filter=notifyMemberIds anyOf
        ["memberId1", "memberId2"]`.

        - `requestorId` filters for only approvals that correspond to the ID of
        the member who requested the approval. For example: `filter=requestorId
        equals 457034721476302714390214`.

        - `resourceId` filters for only approvals that correspond to the the
        specified resource identifier. For example: `filter=resourceId equals
        proj/my-project:env/my-environment:flag/my-flag`.

        - `reviewStatus` filters for only approvals which correspond to the
        review status in the specified list. The possible values are `approved`,
        `declined`, and `pending`. For example: `filter=reviewStatus anyOf
        ["pending", "approved"]`.

        - `status` filters for only approvals which correspond to the status in
        the specified list. The possible values are `pending`, `scheduled`,
        `failed`, and `completed`. For example: `filter=status anyOf ["pending",
        "scheduled"]`.


        You can also apply multiple filters at once. For example, setting
        `filter=projectKey equals my-project, reviewStatus anyOf
        ["pending","approved"]` matches approval requests which correspond to
        the `my-project` project key, and a review status of either `pending` or
        `approved`.


        ### Expanding approval response


        LaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional
        fields in the response, with the following fields:


        - `flag` includes the flag the approval request belongs to

        - `project` includes the project the approval request belongs to

        - `environments` includes the environments the approval request relates
        to


        For example, `expand=project,flag` includes the `project` and `flag`
        fields in the response.

      summary: List feature flags
      operationId: FeatureFlags_list
      description: >
        Get a list of all feature flags in the given project. By default, each
        flag includes configurations for each environment. You can filter
        environments with the `env` query parameter. For example, setting
        `env=production` restricts the returned configurations to just your
        production environment. You can also filter feature flags by tag with
        the `tag` query parameter.


        > #### Recommended use

        >

        > This endpoint can return a large amount of information. We recommend
        using some or all of these query parameters to decrease response time
        and overall payload size: `limit`, `env`, `query`, and
        `filter=creationDate`.


        ### Filtering flags


        You can filter on certain fields using the `filter` query parameter. For
        example, setting `filter=query:dark-mode,tags:beta+test` matches flags
        with the string `dark-mode` in their key or name, ignoring case, which
        also have the tags `beta` and `test`.


        The `filter` query parameter supports the following arguments:


        | Filter argument       | Description | Example              |

        |-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|

        | `applicationEvaluated`  | A string. It filters the list to flags that
        are evaluated in the application with the given key. |
        `filter=applicationEvaluated:com.launchdarkly.cafe` |

        | `archived`              | (deprecated) A boolean value. It filters the
        list to archived flags. | Use `filter=state:archived` instead |

        | `contextKindsEvaluated` | A `+`-separated list of context kind keys.
        It filters the list to flags which have been evaluated in the past 30
        days for all of the context kinds in the list. |
        `filter=contextKindsEvaluated:user+application` |

        | `codeReferences.max`    | An integer value. Use `0` to return flags
        that do not have code references. | `filter=codeReferences.max:0` |

        | `codeReferences.min`    | An integer value. Use `1` to return flags
        that do have code references. | `filter=codeReferences.min:1` |

        | `creationDate`          | An object with an optional `before` field
        whose value is Unix time in milliseconds. It filters the list to flags
        created before the date. |
        `filter=creationDate:{"before":1690527600000}` |

        | `evaluated`             | An object that contains a key of `after` and
        a value in Unix time in milliseconds. It filters the list to all flags
        that have been evaluated since the time you specify, in the environment
        provided. This filter requires the `filterEnv` filter. |
        `filter=evaluation:{"after":1690527600000}` |

        | `filterEnv`             | A string with a list of comma-separated keys
        of valid environments. You must use this field for filters that are
        environment-specific. If there are multiple environment-specific
        filters, you only need to include this field once. You can filter for a
        maximum of three environments. | `filter=evaluated:{"after":
        1590768455282},filterEnv:production,status:active` |

        | `hasExperiment`         | A boolean value. It filters the list to
        flags that are used in an experiment. | `filter=hasExperiment:true` |

        | `maintainerId`          | A valid member ID. It filters the list to
        flags that are maintained by this member. |
        `filter=maintainerId:12ab3c45de678910abc12345` |

        | `maintainerTeamKey`     | A string. It filters the list to flags that
        are maintained by the team with this key. |
        `filter=maintainerTeamKey:example-team-key` |

        | `query`                 | A string. It filters the list to flags that
        include the specified string in their key or name. It is not case
        sensitive. | `filter=query:example` |

        | `state`                 | A string, either `live`, `deprecated`, or
        `archived`. It filters the list to flags in this state. |
        `filter=state:archived` |

        | `sdkAvailability`       | A string, one of `client`, `mobile`,
        `anyClient`, `server`. Using `client` filters the list to flags whose
        client-side SDK availability is set to use the client-side ID. Using
        `mobile` filters to flags set to use the mobile key. Using `anyClient`
        filters to flags set to use either the client-side ID or the mobile key.
        Using `server` filters to flags set to use neither, that is, to flags
        only available in server-side SDKs.  | `filter=sdkAvailability:client` |

        | `tags`                  | A `+`-separated list of tags. It filters the
        list to flags that have all of the tags in the list. |
        `filter=tags:beta+test` |

        | `type`                  | A string, either `temporary` or `permanent`.
        It filters the list to flags with the specified type. |
        `filter=type:permanent` |


        The documented values for the `filter` query are prior to URL encoding.
        For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:beta+test` must be encoded to
        `%2B`.


        By default, this endpoint returns all flags. You can page through the
        list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`,
        `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links
        will not be present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example,
        the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the
        first page.


        ### Sorting flags


        You can sort flags based on the following fields:


        - `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the flag.

        - `key` sorts by the key of the flag.

        - `maintainerId` sorts by the flag maintainer.

        - `name` sorts by flag name.

        - `tags` sorts by tags.

        - `targetingModifiedDate` sorts by the date that the flag's targeting
        rules were last modified in a given environment. It must be used with
        `env` parameter and it can not be combined with any other sort. If
        multiple `env` values are provided, it will perform sort using the first
        one. For example,
        `sort=-targetingModifiedDate&env=production&env=staging` returns results
        sorted by `targetingModifiedDate` for the `production` environment.

        - `type` sorts by flag type


        All fields are sorted in ascending order by default. To sort in
        descending order, prefix the field with a dash ( - ). For example,
        `sort=-name` sorts the response by flag name in descending order.


        ### Expanding response


        LaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional
        fields in the response, with the following fields:


        - `codeReferences` includes code references for the feature flag

        - `evaluation` includes evaluation information within returned
        environments, including which context kinds the flag has been evaluated
        for in the past 30 days

        - `migrationSettings` includes migration settings information within the
        flag and within returned environments. These settings are only included
        for migration flags, that is, where `purpose` is `migration`.


        For example, `expand=evaluation` includes the `evaluation` field in the
        response.


        ### Migration flags

        For migration flags, the cohort information is included in the `rules`
        property of a flag's response, and default cohort information is
        included in the `fallthrough` property of a flag's response.

        Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).

        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>creating a migration
        flag</strong></summary>


        ### Creating a migration flag


        When you create a migration flag, the variations are pre-determined
        based on the number of stages in the migration.


        To create a migration flag, omit the `variations` and `defaults`
        information. Instead, provide a `purpose` of `migration`, and
        `migrationSettings`. If you create a migration flag with six stages,
        `contextKind` is required. Otherwise, it should be omitted.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "key": "flag-key-123",
          "purpose": "migration",
          "migrationSettings": {
            "stageCount": 6,
            "contextKind": "account"
          }
        }

        ```

        Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).

      description: >
        Get a single feature flag by key. By default, this returns the
        configurations for all environments. You can filter environments with
        the `env` query parameter. For example, setting `env=production`
        restricts the returned configurations to just the `production`
        environment.


        > #### Recommended use

        >

        > This endpoint can return a large amount of information. Specifying one
        or multiple environments with the `env` parameter can decrease response
        time and overall payload size. We recommend using this parameter to
        return only the environments relevant to your query.


        ### Expanding response


        LaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional
        fields in the response, with the following fields:


        - `evaluation` includes evaluation information within returned
        environments, including which context kinds the flag has been evaluated
        for in the past 30 days 

        - `migrationSettings` includes migration settings information within the
        flag and within returned environments. These settings are only included
        for migration flags, that is, where `purpose` is `migration`.


        For example, `expand=evaluation` includes the `evaluation` field in the
        response.

      description: "Perform a partial update to a feature flag. The request body must be a valid semantic patch, JSON patch, or JSON merge patch. To learn more the different formats, read [Updates](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).\n\n### Using semantic patches on a feature flag\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).\n\nThe body of a semantic patch request for updating feature flags takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some instructions only) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object. The body of a single semantic patch can contain many different instructions.\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating feature flags.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>turning flags on and off</strong></summary>\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey` parameter.\n\n#### turnFlagOff\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **Off**.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnFlagOn\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **On**.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n</details><br />\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>working with targeting and variations</strong></summary>\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey` parameter.\n\nSeveral of the instructions for working with targeting and variations require flag rule IDs, variation IDs, or clause IDs as parameters. Each of these are returned as part of the [Get feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) response. The flag rule ID is the `_id` field of each element in the `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object. The variation ID is the `_id` field in each element of the `variations` array. The clause ID is the `_id` field of each element of the `clauses` array within the `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object.\n\n#### addClauses\n\nAdds the given clauses to the rule indicated by `ruleId`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauses`: Array of clause objects, with `contextKind` (string), `attribute` (string), `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers, or dates) properties. The `contextKind`, `attribute`, and `values` are case sensitive. The `op` must be lower-case.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n\t\"instructions\": [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addClauses\",\n\t\t\"ruleId\": \"a902ef4a-2faf-4eaf-88e1-ecc356708a29\",\n\t\t\"clauses\": [{\n\t\t\t\"contextKind\": \"user\",\n\t\t\t\"attribute\": \"country\",\n\t\t\t\"op\": \"in\",\n\t\t\t\"negate\": false,\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\"USA\", \"Canada\"]\n\t\t}]\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addPrerequisite\n\nAdds the flag indicated by `key` with variation `variationId` as a prerequisite to the flag in the path parameter.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `key`: Flag key of the prerequisite flag.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation of the prerequisite flag.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n\t\"instructions\": [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addPrerequisite\",\n\t\t\"key\": \"example-prereq-flag-key\",\n\t\t\"variationId\": \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\"\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addRule\n\nAdds a new targeting rule to the flag. The rule may contain `clauses` and serve the variation that `variationId` indicates, or serve a percentage rollout that `rolloutWeights`, `rolloutBucketBy`, and `rolloutContextKind` indicate.\n\nIf you set `beforeRuleId`, this adds the new rule before the indicated rule.

To set a new maintainer, use the flag's **Settings** tab in the LaunchDarkly user interface.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"removeMaintainer\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeTags\n\nRemoves tags from the feature flag.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: A list of tags to remove.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"removeTags\", \"values\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"] } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### replaceCustomProperties\n\nReplaces the existing associated values for a custom property with the new values.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n - `key`: The custom property key.\n - `name`: The custom property name.\n - `values`: A list of the new associated values for the custom property.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n \"instructions\": [{\n   \"kind\": \"replaceCustomProperties\",\n   \"key\": \"example-custom-property\",\n   \"name\": \"Example custom property\",\n   \"values\": [\"value1\", \"value2\"]\n }]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnOffClientSideAvailability\n\nTurns off client-side SDK availability for the flag. This is equivalent to unchecking the **SDKs using Mobile Key** and/or **SDKs using client-side ID** boxes for the flag. If you're using a client-side or mobile SDK, you must expose your feature flags in order for the client-side or mobile SDKs to evaluate them.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Use \"usingMobileKey\" to turn off availability for mobile SDKs. Use \"usingEnvironmentId\" to turn on availability for client-side SDKs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnOffClientSideAvailability\", \"value\": \"usingMobileKey\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnOnClientSideAvailability\n\nTurns on client-side SDK availability for the flag. This is equivalent to unchecking the **SDKs using Mobile Key** and/or **SDKs using client-side ID** boxes for the flag. If you're using a client-side or mobile SDK, you must expose your feature flags in order for the client-side or mobile SDKs to evaluate them.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Use \"usingMobileKey\" to turn on availability for mobile SDKs. Use \"usingEnvironmentId\" to turn on availability for client-side SDKs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnOnClientSideAvailability\", \"value\": \"usingMobileKey\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateDescription\n\nUpdates the feature flag description.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new description.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateDescription\", \"value\": \"Updated flag description\" } ]\n}\n```\n#### updateMaintainerMember\n\nUpdates the maintainer of the flag to an existing member and removes the existing maintainer.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The ID of the member.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateMaintainerMember\", \"value\": \"61e9b714fd47591727db558a\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateMaintainerTeam\n\nUpdates the maintainer of the flag to an existing team and removes the existing maintainer.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The key of the team.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateMaintainerTeam\", \"value\": \"example-team-key\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates the feature flag name.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new name.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateName\", \"value\": \"Updated flag name\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n</details><br />\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating the flag lifecycle</strong></summary>\n\nThese instructions do not require the `environmentKey` parameter. They make changes that apply to the flag across all environments.\n\n#### archiveFlag\n\nArchives the feature flag. This retires it from LaunchDarkly without deleting it. You cannot archive a flag that is a prerequisite of other flags.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"archiveFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### deleteFlag\n\nDeletes the feature flag and its rules. You cannot restore a deleted flag. If this flag is requested again, the flag value defined in code will be returned for all contexts.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"deleteFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### deprecateFlag\n\nDeprecates the feature flag. This hides it from the live flags list without archiving or deleting it.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"deprecateFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### restoreDeprecatedFlag\n\nRestores the feature flag if it was previously deprecated.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"restoreDeprecatedFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### restoreFlag\n\nRestores the feature flag if it was previously archived.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"restoreFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Using JSON patches on a feature flag\n\nIf you do not include the semantic patch header described above, you can use a [JSON patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) or [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) representation of the desired changes.\n\nIn the JSON patch representation, use a JSON pointer in the `path` element to describe what field to change. Use the [Get feature flag](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) endpoint to find the field you want to update.\n\nThere are a few special cases to keep in mind when determining the value of the `path` element:\n\n  * To add an individual target to a specific variation if the flag variation already has individual targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/0/values/-\",\n      \"value\": \"TestClient10\"\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add an individual target to a specific variation if the flag variation does not already have individual targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/-\",\n      \"value\": { \"variation\": 0, \"values\": [\"TestClient10\"] }\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add a flag to a release pipeline, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/releasePipelineKey\",\n      \"value\": \"example-release-pipeline-key\"\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Required approvals\nIf a request attempts to alter a flag configuration in an environment where approvals are required for the flag, the request will fail with a 405. Changes to the flag configuration in that environment will require creating an [approval request](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) or a [workflow](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).\n\n### Conflicts\nIf a flag configuration change made through this endpoint would cause a pending scheduled change or approval request to fail, this endpoint will return a 400. You can ignore this check by adding an `ignoreConflicts` query parameter set to `true`.\n\n### Migration flags\nFor migration flags, the cohort information is included in the `rules` property of a flag's response. You can update cohorts by updating `rules`. Default cohort information is included in the `fallthrough` property of a flag's response. You can update the default cohort by updating `fallthrough`.\nWhen you update the rollout for a cohort or the default cohort through the API, provide a rollout instead of a single `variationId`.\nTo learn more, read [Migration Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).\n"

        Copy flag settings from a source environment to a target environment.


        By default, this operation copies the entire flag configuration. You can
        use the `includedActions` or `excludedActions` to specify that only part
        of the flag configuration is copied.


        If you provide the optional `currentVersion` of a flag, this operation
        tests to ensure that the current flag version in the environment matches
        the version you've specified. The operation rejects attempts to copy
        flag settings if the environment's current version  of the flag does not
        match the version you've specified. You can use this to enforce
        optimistic locking on copy attempts.

      summary: Update expiring context targets on feature flag
      operationId: FeatureFlags_updateExpiringContextTargets
      description: >
        Schedule a context for removal from individual targeting on a feature
        flag. The flag must already individually target the context.


        You can add, update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only
        schedule a context for removal on a single variation per flag.


        Updating an expiring target uses the semantic patch format. To make a
        semantic patch request, you must append
        `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.
        To learn more, read [Updates using semantic
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        ### Instructions


        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for
        updating expiring targets.


        <details>

        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring
        targets</strong></summary>


        #### addExpiringTarget


        Adds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the context from the
        flag's individual targeting.


        ##### Parameters


        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should
        remove the context from individual targeting for this flag

        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag

        * `contextKey`: The context key for the context to remove from
        individual targeting

        * `contextKind`: The kind of context represented by the `contextKey`


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addExpiringTarget",
            "value": 1754006460000,
            "variationId": "4254742c-71ae-411f-a992-43b18a51afe0",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user"
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### updateExpiringTarget


        Updates the date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the context from
        the flag's individual targeting


        ##### Parameters


        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should
        remove the context from individual targeting for this flag

        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag

        * `contextKey`: The context key for the context to remove from
        individual targeting

        * `contextKind`: The kind of context represented by the `contextKey`

        * `version`: (Optional) The version of the expiring target to update. If
        included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of
        the expiring target.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateExpiringTarget",
            "value": 1754006460000,
            "variationId": "4254742c-71ae-411f-a992-43b18a51afe0",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user"
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### removeExpiringTarget


        Removes the scheduled removal of the context from the flag's individual
        targeting. The context will remain part of the flag's individual
        targeting until you explicitly remove it, or until you schedule another
        removal.


        ##### Parameters


        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag

        * `contextKey`: The context key for the context to remove from
        individual targeting

        * `contextKind`: The kind of context represented by the `contextKey`


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeExpiringTarget",
            "variationId": "4254742c-71ae-411f-a992-43b18a51afe0",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user"
          }]

      summary: Update flag trigger
      operationId: FlagTriggers_updateTriggerWorkflowPatch
      description: >
        Update a flag trigger. Updating a flag trigger uses the semantic patch
        format.


        To make a semantic patch request, you must append
        `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.
        To learn more, read [Updates using semantic
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        ### Instructions


        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for
        updating flag triggers.


        <details>

        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating flag
        triggers</strong></summary>


        #### replaceTriggerActionInstructions


        Removes the existing trigger action and replaces it with the new
        instructions.


        ##### Parameters


        - `value`: An array of the new `kind`s of actions to perform when
        triggering. Supported flag actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.


        Here's an example that replaces the existing action with new
        instructions to turn flag targeting off:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [
            {
              "kind": "replaceTriggerActionInstructions",
              "value": [ {"kind": "turnFlagOff"} ]
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        #### cycleTriggerUrl


        Generates a new URL for this trigger. You must update any clients using
        the trigger to use this new URL.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "cycleTriggerUrl" }]
        }

        ```


        #### disableTrigger


        Disables the trigger. This saves the trigger configuration, but the
        trigger stops running. To re-enable, use `enableTrigger`.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "disableTrigger" }]
        }

        ```


        #### enableTrigger


        Enables the trigger. If you previously disabled the trigger, it begins
        running again.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "enableTrigger" }]
        }

        ```

        You can only use this endpoint to mark a release phase complete or
        incomplete. To indicate which phase to update, use the array index in
        the `path`. For example, to mark the first phase of a release as
        complete, use the following request body:


        ```
          [
            {
              "op": "replace",

        Create a persistent store integration.


        If you are using server-side SDKs, segments synced from external tools
        and larger list-based segments require a persistent store within your
        infrastructure. LaunchDarkly keeps the persistent store up to date and
        consults it during flag evaluation.


        You can use either Redis or DynamoDB as your persistent store. When you
        create a persistent store integration, the fields in the `config` object
        in the request vary depending on which persistent store you use.


        If you are using Redis to create your persistent store integration, you
        will need to know:


        * Your Redis host

        * Your Redis port

        * Your Redis username

        * Your Redis password

        * Whether or not LaunchDarkly should connect using TLS


        If you are using DynamoDB to create your persistent store integration,
        you will need to know:


        * Your DynamoDB table name. The table must have the following schema:
          * Partition key: `namespace` (string)
          * Sort key: `key` (string)
        * Your DynamoDB Amazon Web Services (AWS) region.

        * Your AWS role Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This is the role that
        LaunchDarkly will assume to manage your DynamoDB table.

        * The External ID you specified when creating your Amazon Resource Name
        (ARN).

        By default, this returns the first 20 members. Page through this list
        with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`,
        and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links are not
        present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first`
        and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.


        ### Filtering members


        LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:


        - `query` is a string that matches against the members' emails and
        names. It is not case sensitive.

        - `role` is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. It filters
        the list to members who have any of the roles in the list. For the
        purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.

        - `team` is a string that matches against the key of the teams the
        members belong to. It is not case sensitive.

        - `noteam` is a boolean that filters the list of members who are not on
        a team if true and members on a team if false.

        - `lastSeen` is a JSON object in one of the following formats:
          - `{"never": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.
          - `{"noData": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.
          - `{"before": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.
        - `accessCheck` is a string that represents a specific action on a
        specific resource and is in the format
        `<ActionSpecifier>:<ResourceSpecifier>`. It filters the list to members
        who have the ability to perform that action on that resource. Note:
        `accessCheck` is only supported in API version `20220603` and earlier.
        To learn more, read
        [Versioning](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/#section/Overview/Versioning).
          - For example, the filter `accessCheck:createApprovalRequest:proj/default:env/test:flag/alternate-page` matches members with the ability to create an approval request for the `alternate-page` flag in the `test` environment of the `default` project.
          - Wildcard and tag filters are not supported when filtering for access.

        For example, the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole` matches
        members with the string `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case, who
        also are either an `Owner` or `Admin` or have the custom role
        `customrole`.


        ### Sorting members


        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName` and
        `lastSeen`:


        - `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the member's email if
        no name is set.

        - `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen` property. LaunchDarkly considers
        members that have never been seen or have no data the oldest.

      operationId: AccountMembers_inviteNewMembers
      description: >
        Invite one or more new members to join an account. Each member is sent
        an invitation. Members with "admin" or "owner" roles may create new
        members, as well as anyone with a "createMember" permission for
        "member/\*". If a member cannot be invited, the entire request is
        rejected and no members are invited from that request.


        Each member _must_ have an `email` field and either a `role` or a
        `customRoles` field. If any of the fields are not populated correctly,
        the request is rejected with the reason specified in the "message" field
        of the response.


        Requests to create account members will not work if SCIM is enabled for
        the account.


        _No more than 50 members may be created per request._


        A request may also fail because of conflicts with existing members.
        These conflicts are reported using the additional `code` and
        `invalid_emails` response fields with the following possible values for
        `code`:


        - **email_already_exists_in_account**: A member with this email address
        already exists in this account.

        - **email_taken_in_different_account**: A member with this email address
        exists in another account.

        - **duplicate_email**s: This request contains two or more members with
        the same email address.


        A request that fails for one of the above reasons returns an HTTP
        response code of 400 (Bad Request).

        >

        > The ability to perform a partial update to multiple members is
        available to customers on an Enterprise plan. If you are on a Pro plan,
        you can update members individually. To learn more, [read about our
        pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan,
        [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).


        Perform a partial update to multiple members. Updating members uses the
        semantic patch format.


        To make a semantic patch request, you must append
        `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.
        To learn more, read [Updates using semantic
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        ### Instructions


        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for
        updating members.

          }]
        }

        ```


        #### replaceAllMembersRoles


        Replaces the roles of all members. This also removes all custom roles
        assigned to the specified members.


        Members that match any of the filters are **excluded** from the update.


        ##### Parameters


        - `value`: The new role. Must be a valid built-in role. To learn more

      summary: Modify an account member
      operationId: AccountMembers_updateMemberPatch
      description: >

        Update a single account member. Updating a member uses a [JSON
        patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) representation of
        the desired changes. To learn more, read
        [Updates](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        To update fields in the account member object that are arrays, set the
        `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Use
        `/0` to add to the beginning of the array. Use `/-` to add to the end of
        the array. For example, to add a new custom role to a member, use the
        following request body:


        ```
          [
            {
              "op": "add",
              "path": "/customRoles/0",
              "value": "some-role-id"
            }
          ]
        ```


        You can update only an account member's role or custom role using a JSON
        patch. Members can update their own names and email addresses though the
        LaunchDarkly UI.


        When SAML SSO or SCIM is enabled for the account, account members are
        managed in the Identity Provider (IdP). Requests to update account
        members will succeed, but the IdP will override the update shortly
        afterwards.

        ### Expanding the metric list response

        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the "List metrics" response. By default,
        the expandable field is **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add the
        following supported field:


        - `experimentCount` includes the number of experiments from the specific
        project that use the metric


        For example, `expand=experimentCount` includes the `experimentCount`
        field for each metric in the response.

        ### Expanding the metric response

        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Get metric"
        response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with any of the following fields:


        - `experiments` includes all experiments from the specific project that
        use the metric

        - `experimentCount` includes the number of experiments from the specific
        project that use the metric

        - `metricGroups` includes all metric groups from the specific project
        that use the metric

        - `metricGroupCount` includes the number of metric groups from the
        specific project that use the metric


        For example, `expand=experiments` includes the `experiments` field in
        the response.

        Return a list of projects.


        By default, this returns the first 20 projects. Page through this list
        with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`,
        and `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those links do
        not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the
        `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first
        page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the
        first page when you are already on the first page.


        ### Filtering projects


        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:

        - `query` is a string that matches against the projects' names and keys.
        It is not case sensitive.

        - `tags` is a `+`-separated list of project tags. It filters the list of
        projects that have all of the tags in the list.


        For example, the filter `filter=query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches
        projects with the string `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged
        with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.


        The documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL
        encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2` must be
        encoded to `%2B`.


        ### Sorting projects


        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting:

        - `name` sorts by project name.

        - `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the project.


        For example, `sort=name` sorts the response by project name in ascending
        order.


        ### Expanding the projects response


        LaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the "List projects"
        response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with the `environments` field.


        `Environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.

        * `environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.


        For example, `expand=environments` includes the `environments` field for
        each project in the response.

      summary: List environments
      operationId: Environments_listEnvironments
      description: >
        Return a list of environments for the specified project.


        By default, this returns the first 20 environments. Page through this
        list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`,
        `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those
        links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example,
        the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the
        first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to
        the first page when you are already on the first page.


        ### Filtering environments


        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:

        - `query` is a string that matches against the environments' names and
        keys. It is not case sensitive.

        - `tags` is a `+`-separated list of environment tags. It filters the
        list of environments that have all of the tags in the list.


        For example, the filter `filter=query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches
        environments with the string `abc` in their name or key and also are
        tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.


        The documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL
        encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2` must be
        encoded to `%2B`.


        ### Sorting environments


        LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for sorting:


        - `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the environment.

        - `critical` sorts by whether the environments are marked as critical.

        - `name` sorts by environment name.


        For example, `sort=name` sorts the response by environment name in
        ascending order.

      summary: Update environment

      description: >

        Update an environment. Updating an environment uses a [JSON
        patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) representation of
        the desired changes. To learn more, read
        [Updates](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        To update fields in the environment object that are arrays, set the
        `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Using
        `/0` appends to the beginning of the array.


        ### Approval settings


        This request only returns the `approvalSettings` key if the [Flag
        Approvals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/approvals)
        feature is enabled.


        Only the `canReviewOwnRequest`, `canApplyDeclinedChanges`,
        `minNumApprovals`, `required` and `requiredApprovalTagsfields` are
        editable.


        If you try to patch the environment by setting both `required` and
        `requiredApprovalTags`, the request fails and an error appears. You can
        specify either required approvals for all flags in an environment or
        those with specific tags, but not both.

        Omitting the `setting` attribute from the request body, or including a
        `setting` of `null`, erases the current setting for a context.


        If you previously patched the flag, and the patch included the context's
        data, LaunchDarkly continues to use that data. If LaunchDarkly has never
        encountered the combination of the context's key and kind before, it
        calculates the flag values based on the context kind and key.

        ### Filtering experiments


        LaunchDarkly supports the `filter` query param for filtering, with the
        following fields:


        - `flagKey` filters for only experiments that use the flag with the
        given key.

        - `metricKey` filters for only experiments that use the metric with the
        given key.

        - `status` filters for only experiments with an iteration with the given
        status. An iteration can have the status `not_started`, `running` or
        `stopped`.


        For example,
        `filter=flagKey:my-flag,status:running,metricKey:page-load-ms` filters
        for experiments for the given flag key and the given metric key which
        have a currently running iteration.


        ### Expanding the experiments response


        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Get experiments"
        response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with any of the following fields:


        - `previousIterations` includes all iterations prior to the current
        iteration. By default only the current iteration is included in the
        response.

        - `draftIteration` includes the iteration which has not been started
        yet, if any.

        - `secondaryMetrics` includes secondary metrics. By default only the
        primary metric is included in the response.

        - `treatments` includes all treatment and parameter details. By default
        treatment data is not included in the response.


        For example, `expand=draftIteration,treatments` includes the
        `draftIteration` and `treatments` fields in the response. If fields that
        you request with the `expand` query parameter are empty, they are not
        included in the response.

        ### Expanding the experiment response


        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Get experiment"
        response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with any of the following fields:


        - `previousIterations` includes all iterations prior to the current
        iteration. By default only the current iteration is included in the
        response.

        - `draftIteration` includes the iteration which has not been started
        yet, if any.

        - `secondaryMetrics` includes secondary metrics. By default only the
        primary metric is included in the response.

        - `treatments` includes all treatment and parameter details. By default
        treatment data is not included in the response.


        For example, `expand=draftIteration,treatments` includes the
        `draftIteration` and `treatments` fields in the response. If fields that
        you request with the `expand` query parameter are empty, they are not
        included in the response.

      summary: Patch experiment
      operationId: ExperimentsBeta_updateSemanticPatch
      description: >
        Update an experiment. Updating an experiment uses the semantic patch
        format.


        To make a semantic patch request, you must append
        `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.
        To learn more, read [Updates using semantic
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        ### Instructions


        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for
        updating experiments.


        #### updateName


        Updates the experiment name.


        ##### Parameters


        - `value`: The new name.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateName",
            "value": "Example updated experiment name"
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### updateDescription


        Updates the experiment description.


        ##### Parameters


        - `value`: The new description.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateDescription",
            "value": "Example updated description"
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### startIteration


        Starts a new iteration for this experiment. You must [create a new
        iteration](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/createIteration)
        before calling this instruction.


        An iteration may not be started until it meets the following criteria:


        * Its associated flag is toggled on and is not archived

        * Its `randomizationUnit` is set

        * At least one of its `treatments` has a non-zero `allocationPercent`


        ##### Parameters


        - `changeJustification`: The reason for starting a new iteration.
        Required when you call `startIteration` on an already running
        experiment, otherwise optional.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "startIteration",
            "changeJustification": "It's time to start a new iteration"
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### stopIteration


        Stops the current iteration for this experiment.


        ##### Parameters


        - `winningTreatmentId`: The ID of the winning treatment. Treatment IDs
        are returned as part of the [Get
        experiment](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/getExperiment)
        response. They are the `_id` of each element in the `treatments` array.

        - `winningReason`: The reason for the winner


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "stopIteration",
            "winningTreatmentId": "3a548ec2-72ac-4e59-8518-5c24f5609ccf",
            "winningReason": "Example reason to stop the iteration"
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### archiveExperiment


        Archives this experiment. Archived experiments are hidden by default in
        the LaunchDarkly user interface. You cannot start new iterations for
        archived experiments.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "archiveExperiment" }]
        }

        ```


        #### restoreExperiment


        Restores an archived experiment. After restoring an experiment, you can
        start new iterations for it again.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "restoreExperiment" }]
        }

        ```

        Experiment iterations let you record experiments in individual blocks of
        time. Initially, iterations are created with a status of `not_started`
        and appear in the `draftIteration` field of an experiment. To start or
        stop an iteration, [update the
        experiment](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)#operation/patchExperiment)
        with the `startIteration` or `stopIteration` instruction.

        LaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the "Get experiment
        results" response. By default, this field is **not** included in the
        response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter with the
        following field:

        * `traffic` includes the total count of units for each treatment.


        For example, `expand=traffic` includes the `traffic` field for the
        project in the response.

      description: >
        Evaluate flags for a context instance, for example, to determine the
        expected flag variation. **Do not use this API instead of an SDK.** The
        LaunchDarkly SDKs are specialized for the tasks of evaluating feature
        flags in your application at scale and generating analytics events based
        on those evaluations. This API is not designed for that use case. Any
        evaluations you perform with this API will not be reflected in features
        such as flag statuses and flag insights. Context instances evaluated by
        this API will not appear in the Contexts list. To learn more, read
        [Comparing LaunchDarkly's SDKs and REST
        API](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/guide/api/comparing-sdk-rest-api).


        ### Filtering 


        LaunchDarkly supports the `filter` query param for filtering, with the
        following fields:


        - `query` filters for a string that matches against the flags' keys and
        names. It is not case sensitive. For example: `filter=query equals
        dark-mode`.

        - `tags` filters the list to flags that have all of the tags in the
        list. For example: `filter=tags contains ["beta","q1"]`.


        You can also apply multiple filters at once. For example, setting
        `filter=query equals dark-mode, tags contains ["beta","q1"]` matches
        flags which match the key or name `dark-mode` and are tagged `beta` and
        `q1`.

      operationId: ScheduledChanges_updateWorkflow
      description: >

        Update a scheduled change, overriding existing instructions with the new
        ones. Updating a scheduled change uses the semantic patch format.


        To make a semantic patch request, you must append
        `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.
        To learn more, read [Updates using semantic
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        ### Instructions


        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for
        updating scheduled changes.


        <details>

        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating scheduled
        changes</strong></summary>


        #### deleteScheduledChange


        Removes the scheduled change.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{ "kind": "deleteScheduledChange" }]
        }

        ```


        #### replaceScheduledChangesInstructions


        Removes the existing scheduled changes and replaces them with the new
        instructions.


        ##### Parameters


        - `value`: An array of the new actions to perform when the execution
        date for these scheduled changes arrives. Supported scheduled actions
        are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.


        Here's an example that replaces the scheduled changes with new
        instructions to turn flag targeting off:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [
            {
              "kind": "replaceScheduledChangesInstructions",
              "value": [ {"kind": "turnFlagOff"} ]
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        #### updateScheduledChangesExecutionDate


        Updates the execution date for the scheduled changes.


        ##### Parameters


        - `value`: the new execution date, in Unix milliseconds.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [
            {
              "kind": "updateScheduledChangesExecutionDate",
              "value": 1754092860000
            }
          ]
        }

        ```

      operationId: Workflows_createWorkflow
      description: "Create a workflow for a feature flag. You can create a workflow directly, or you can apply a template to create a new workflow.\n\n### Creating a workflow\n\nYou can use the create workflow endpoint to create a workflow directly by adding a `stages` array to the request body.\n\nFor each stage, define the `name`, `conditions` when the stage should be executed, and `action` that describes the stage.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand example</summary>\n\n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Progressive rollout starting in two days\",\n  \"description\": \"Turn flag targeting on and increase feature rollout in 10% increments each day\",\n  \"stages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"10% rollout on day 1\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"schedule\",\n          \"scheduleKind\": \"relative\", // or \"absolute\"\n              //  If \"scheduleKind\" is \"absolute\", set \"executionDate\";\n              // \"waitDuration\" and \"waitDurationUnit\" will be ignored\n          \"waitDuration\": 2,\n          \"waitDurationUnit\": \"calendarDay\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"ld-approval\",\n          \"notifyMemberIds\": [ \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ],\n          \"notifyTeamKeys\": [ \"team-key-123abc\" ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"action\": {\n        \"instructions\": [\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"updateFallthroughVariationOrRollout\",\n            \"rolloutWeights\": {\n              \"452f5fb5-7320-4ba3-81a1-8f4324f79d49\": 90000,\n              \"fc15f6a4-05d3-4aa4-a997-446be461345d\": 10000\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n### Creating a workflow by applying a workflow template\n\nYou can also create a workflow by applying a workflow template. If you pass a valid workflow template key as the `templateKey` query parameter with the request, the API will attempt to create a new workflow with the stages defined in the workflow template with the corresponding key.\n\n#### Applicability of stages\nTemplates are created in the context of a particular flag in a particular environment in a particular project. However, because workflows created from a template can be applied to any project, environment, and flag, some steps of the workflow may need to be updated in order to be applicable for the target resource.\n\nYou can pass a `dryRun` query parameter to tell the API to return a report of which steps of the workflow template are applicable in the target project/environment/flag, and which will need to be updated. When the `dryRun` query parameter is present the response body includes a `meta` property that holds a list of parameters that could potentially be inapplicable for the target resource. Each of these parameters will include a `valid` field. You will need to update any invalid parameters in order to create the new workflow. You can do this using the `parameters` property, which overrides the workflow template parameters.\n\n#### Overriding template parameters\nYou can use the `parameters` property in the request body to tell the API to override the specified workflow template parameters with new values that are specific to your target project/environment/flag.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand example</summary>\n\n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n\t\"name\": \"workflow created from my-template\",\n\t\"description\": \"description of my workflow\",\n\t\"parameters\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3b\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/clauses/0/values\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": [\"updated-segment\"]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3d\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/variationId\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd12\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nIf there are any steps in the template that are not applicable to the target resource, the workflow will not be created, and the `meta` property will be included in the response body detailing which parameters need to be updated.\n"

        ### Expanding the metric groups response

        LaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the "Get metric groups"
        response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with the following field:


        - `experiments` includes all experiments from the specific project that
        use the metric group


        For example, `expand=experiments` includes the `experiments` field in
        the response.

        ### Expanding the metric group response

        LaunchDarkly supports two fields for expanding the "Get metric group"
        response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with either or both of the following fields:


        - `experiments` includes all experiments from the specific project that
        use the metric group

        - `experimentCount` includes the number of experiments from the specific
        project that use the metric group


        For example, `expand=experiments` includes the `experiments` field in
        the response.

        ### Filtering release pipelines


        LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:


        - `query` is a string that matches against the release pipeline `key`,
        `name`, and `description`. It is not case sensitive. For example:
        `?filter=query:examplePipeline`.
      parameters:
        - description: The project key

        The first release pipeline you create is automatically set as the
        default release pipeline for your project. To change the default release
        pipeline, use the [Update project](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) API
        to set the `defaultReleasePipelineKey`.


        You can create up to 20 release pipelines per project.

        You cannot delete the default release pipeline.


        If you want to delete a release pipeline that is currently the default,
        create a second release pipeline and set it as the default. Then delete
        the first release pipeline. To change the default release pipeline, use
        the [Update project](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) API to set the
        `defaultReleasePipelineKey`.

        patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) or [JSON merge
        patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) representation of
        the desired changes. To learn more, read
        [Updates](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).<br/><br/>To add an element
        to the `policy` array, set the `path` to `/policy` and then append
        `/<array index>`. Use `/0` to add to the beginning of the array. Use
        `/-` to add to the end of the array.

        - Segments
      summary: Patch segment
      operationId: Segments_updateSemanticPatch
      description: >
        Update a segment. The request body must be a valid semantic patch, JSON
        patch, or JSON merge patch. To learn more the different formats, read
        [Updates](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        ### Using semantic patches on a segment


        To make a semantic patch request, you must append
        `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.
        To learn more, read [Updates using semantic
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        The body of a semantic patch request for updating segments requires an
        `environmentKey` in addition to `instructions` and an optional
        `comment`. The body of the request takes the following properties:


        * `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.

        * `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly
        environment.

        * `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should
        perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind`
        property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires
        parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in
        the object.


        ### Instructions


        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for
        updating segments.


        <details>

        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating
        segments</strong></summary>


        #### addIncludedTargets


        Adds context keys to the individual context targets included in the
        segment for the specified `contextKind`. Returns an error if this causes
        the same context key to be both included and excluded.


        ##### Parameters


        - `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be added to.

        - `values`: List of keys.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addIncludedTargets",
            "contextKind": "org",
            "values": [ "org-key-123abc", "org-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### addIncludedUsers


        Adds user keys to the individual user targets included in the segment.
        Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included
        and excluded. If you are working with contexts, use `addIncludedTargets`
        instead of this instruction.


        ##### Parameters


        - `values`: List of user keys.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addIncludedUsers",
            "values": [ "user-key-123abc", "user-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### addExcludedTargets


        Adds context keys to the individual context targets excluded in the
        segment for the specified `contextKind`. Returns an error if this causes
        the same context key to be both included and excluded.


        ##### Parameters


        - `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be added to.

        - `values`: List of keys.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addExcludedTargets",
            "contextKind": "org",
            "values": [ "org-key-123abc", "org-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### addExcludedUsers


        Adds user keys to the individual user targets excluded from the segment.
        Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included
        and excluded. If you are working with contexts, use `addExcludedTargets`
        instead of this instruction.


        ##### Parameters


        - `values`: List of user keys.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addExcludedUsers",
            "values": [ "user-key-123abc", "user-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### removeIncludedTargets


        Removes context keys from the individual context targets included in the
        segment for the specified `contextKind`.


        ##### Parameters


        - `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be removed from.

        - `values`: List of keys.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeIncludedTargets",
            "contextKind": "org",
            "values": [ "org-key-123abc", "org-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### removeIncludedUsers


        Removes user keys from the individual user targets included in the
        segment. If you are working with contexts, use `removeIncludedTargets`
        instead of this instruction.


        ##### Parameters


        - `values`: List of user keys.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {

            "kind": "removeIncludedUsers",
            "values": [ "user-key-123abc", "user-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### removeExcludedTargets


        Removes context keys from the individual context targets excluded from
        the segment for the specified `contextKind`.


        ##### Parameters


        - `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be removed from.

        - `values`: List of keys.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeExcludedTargets",
            "contextKind": "org",
            "values": [ "org-key-123abc", "org-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### removeExcludedUsers


        Removes user keys from the individual user targets excluded from the
        segment. If you are working with contexts, use `removeExcludedTargets`
        instead of this instruction.


        ##### Parameters


        - `values`: List of user keys.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeExcludedUsers",
            "values": [ "user-key-123abc", "user-key-456def" ]
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### updateName


        Updates the name of the segment.


        ##### Parameters


        - `value`: Name of the segment.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateName",
            "value": "Updated segment name"
          }]
        }

        ```


        </details>


        ## Using JSON patches on a segment


        If you do not include the header described above, you can use a [JSON
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) or [JSON merge
        patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) representation of
        the desired changes.


        For example, to update the description for a segment with a JSON patch,
        use the following request body:


        ```json

        {
          "patch": [
            {
              "op": "replace",
              "path": "/description",
              "value": "new description"
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        To update fields in the segment that are arrays, set the `path` to the
        name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Use `/0` to add the
        new entry to the beginning of the array. Use `/-` to add the new entry
        to the end of the array.


        For example, to add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:


        ```json

        {
          "patch":[
            {
              "op": "add",
              "path": "/rules/0",
              "value": {
                "clauses": [{ "contextKind": "user", "attribute": "email", "op": "endsWith", "values": [".edu"], "negate": false }]
              }
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        To add or remove targets from segments, we recommend using semantic
        patch. Semantic patch for segments includes specific instructions for
        adding and removing both included and excluded targets.

      summary: Update expiring targets for segment
      operationId: Segments_updateExpiringTargetsForSegment
      description: >

        Update expiring context targets for a segment. Updating a context target
        expiration uses the semantic patch format.


        To make a semantic patch request, you must append
        `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.
        To learn more, read [Updates using semantic
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        If the request is well-formed but any of its instructions failed to
        process, this operation returns status code `200`. In this case, the
        response `errors` array will be non-empty.


        ### Instructions


        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for
        updating expiring context targets.


        <details>

        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring
        context targets</strong></summary>


        #### addExpiringTarget


        Schedules a date and time when LaunchDarkly will remove a context from
        segment targeting. The segment must already have the context as an
        individual target.


        ##### Parameters


        - `targetType`: The type of individual target for this context. Must be
        either `included` or `excluded`.

        - `contextKey`: The context key.

        - `contextKind`: The kind of context being targeted.

        - `value`: The date when the context should expire from the segment
        targeting, in Unix milliseconds.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "addExpiringTarget",
            "targetType": "included",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user",
            "value": 1754092860000
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### updateExpiringTarget


        Updates the date and time when LaunchDarkly will remove a context from
        segment targeting.


        ##### Parameters


        - `targetType`: The type of individual target for this context. Must be
        either `included` or `excluded`.

        - `contextKey`: The context key.

        - `contextKind`: The kind of context being targeted.

        - `value`: The new date when the context should expire from the segment
        targeting, in Unix milliseconds.

        - `version`: (Optional) The version of the expiring target to update. If
        included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of
        the expiring target.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "updateExpiringTarget",
            "targetType": "included",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user",
            "value": 1754179260000
          }]
        }

        ```


        #### removeExpiringTarget


        Removes the scheduled expiration for the context in the segment.


        ##### Parameters


        - `targetType`: The type of individual target for this context. Must be
        either `included` or `excluded`.

        - `contextKey`: The context key.

        - `contextKind`: The kind of context being targeted.


        Here's an example:


        ```json

        {
          "instructions": [{
            "kind": "removeExpiringTarget",
            "targetType": "included",
            "contextKey": "user-key-123abc",
            "contextKind": "user",
          }]
        }

        >

        > After you have upgraded your LaunchDarkly SDK to use contexts instead
        of users, you should use [Update expiring targets for
        segment](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) instead of this endpoint. To

        [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).


        Update expiring user targets for a segment. Updating a user target
        expiration uses the semantic patch format.


        To make a semantic patch request, you must append
        `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.
        To learn more, read [Updates using semantic
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        If the request is well-formed but any of its instructions failed to
        process, this operation returns status code `200`. In this case, the
        response `errors` array will be non-empty.


        ### Instructions


        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for
        updating expiring user targets.

        By default, this returns the first 20 teams. Page through this list with
        the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and
        `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those links do not
        appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first`
        and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page,
        because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first
        page when you are already on the first page.


        ### Filtering teams


        LaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:


        - `query` is a string that matches against the teams' names and keys. It
        is not case-sensitive.
          - A request with `query:abc` returns teams with the string `abc` in their name or key.
        - `nomembers` is a boolean that filters the list of teams who have 0
        members
          - A request with `nomembers:true` returns teams that have 0 members
          - A request with `nomembers:false` returns teams that have 1 or more members

        ### Expanding the teams response

        LaunchDarkly supports expanding several fields in the "List teams"
        response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with any of the following fields:


        * `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.

        * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you
        have assigned to the team.


        For example, `expand=members,maintainers` includes the `members` and
        `maintainers` fields in the response.
      parameters:
        - description: The number of teams to return in the response. Defaults to 20.
          name: limit

        ### Expanding the teams response

        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Create team"
        response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with any of the following fields:


        * `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.

        * `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have
        assigned to the team.

        * `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has
        any write access to.

        * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you
        have assigned to the team.


        For example, `expand=members,roles` includes the `members` and `roles`
        fields in the response.

        - `teamKeys`: List of teams to update.

        - `filterLastSeen`: (Optional) A JSON object with one of the following
        formats:
          - `{"never": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.
          - `{"noData": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.
          - `{"before": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.

        ### Expanding the teams response

        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Get team" response.
        By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with any of the following fields:


        * `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.

        * `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have
        assigned to the team.

        * `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has
        any write access to.

        * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you
        have assigned to the team.


        For example, `expand=members,roles` includes the `members` and `roles`
        fields in the response.

        may have either an `actionSet` or a list of `actions` but not both at

        permission grant.

          }]
        }

        ### Expanding the teams response

        LaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the "Update team"
        response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a
        comma-separated list with any of the following fields:


        * `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.

        * `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have
        assigned to the team.

        * `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has
        any write access to.

        * `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you
        have assigned to the team.


        For example, `expand=members,roles` includes the `members` and `roles`
        fields in the response.

      summary: Add multiple members to team
      operationId: Teams_addMultipleMembersToTeam
      description: >
        Add multiple members to an existing team by uploading a CSV file of
        member email addresses. Your CSV file must include email addresses in
        the first column. You can include data in additional columns, but
        LaunchDarkly ignores all data outside the first column. Headers are
        optional. To learn more, read [Managing team
        members](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/teams/managing#managing-team-members).


        **Members are only added on a `201` response.** A `207` indicates the
        CSV file contains a combination of valid and invalid entries. A `207`
        results in no members being added to the team.


        On a `207` response, if an entry contains bad input, the `message` field
        contains the row number as well as the reason for the error. The
        `message` field is omitted if the entry is valid.


        Example `207` response:

        ```json

        {
          "items": [
            {
              "status": "success",
              "value": "new-team-member@acme.com"
            },
            {
              "message": "Line 2: empty row",
              "status": "error",
              "value": ""
            },
            {
              "message": "Line 3: email already exists in the specified team",
              "status": "error",
              "value": "existing-team-member@acme.com"
            },
            {
              "message": "Line 4: invalid email formatting",
              "status": "error",
              "value": "invalid email format"
            }
          ]
        }

        ```


        Message | Resolution

        --- | ---

        Empty row | This line is blank. Add an email address and try again.

        Duplicate entry | This email address appears in the file twice. Remove
        the email from the file and try again.

        Email already exists in the specified team | This member is already on
        your team. Remove the email from the file and try again.

        Invalid formatting | This email address is not formatted correctly. Fix
        the formatting and try again.

        Email does not belong to a LaunchDarkly member | The email address
        doesn't belong to a LaunchDarkly account member. Invite them to
        LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team.


        On a `400` response, the `message` field may contain errors specific to
        this endpoint.


        Example `400` response:

        ```json

        {
          "code": "invalid_request",
          "message": "Unable to process file"
        }

        ```


        Message | Resolution

        --- | ---

        Unable to process file | LaunchDarkly could not process the file for an
        unspecified reason. Review your file for errors and try again.

        File exceeds 25mb | Break up your file into multiple files of less than
        25mbs each.

        All emails have invalid formatting | None of the email addresses in the
        file are in the correct format. Fix the formatting and try again.

        All emails belong to existing team members | All listed members are
        already on this team. Populate the file with member emails that do not
        belong to the team and try again.

        File is empty | The CSV file does not contain any email addresses.
        Populate the file and try again.

        No emails belong to members of your LaunchDarkly organization | None of
        the email addresses belong to members of your LaunchDarkly account.
        Invite these members to LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team.

        > After you have upgraded your LaunchDarkly SDK to use contexts instead
        of users, you should use [Search for context
        instances](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) instead of this endpoint.


        Search users in LaunchDarkly based on their last active date, a user
        attribute filter set, or a search query.


        An example user attribute filter set is
        `filter=firstName:Anna,activeTrial:false`. This matches users that have
        the user attribute `firstName` set to `Anna`, that also have the
        attribute `activeTrial` set to `false`.


        To paginate through results, follow the `next` link in the `_links`
        object. To learn more, read

        Get a single flag setting for a user by flag key. <br /><br />The
        `_value` is the flag variation that the user receives. The `setting`
        indicates whether you've explicitly targeted a user to receive a
        particular variation. For example, if you have turned off a feature flag
        for a user, this setting will be `false`. The example response indicates
        that the user `Abbie_Braun` has the `sort.order` flag enabled.

        Omitting the `setting` attribute from the request body, or including a
        `setting` of `null`, erases the current setting for a user.


        If you previously patched the flag, and the patch included the user's
        data, LaunchDarkly continues to use that data. If LaunchDarkly has never
        encountered the user's key before, it calculates the flag values based
        on the user key alone.

      tags:

      summary: Update expiring user target for flags
      operationId: UserSettings_updateExpiringUserTarget
      description: >
        Schedule the specified user for removal from individual targeting on one
        or more flags. The user must already be individually targeted for each
        flag.


        You can add, update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only
        schedule a user for removal on a single variation per flag.


        Updating an expiring target uses the semantic patch format. To make a
        semantic patch request, you must append
        `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.
        To learn more, read [Updates using semantic
        patch](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com).


        ### Instructions


        Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for
        updating expiring user targets.


        <details>

        <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring user
        targets</strong></summary>


        #### addExpireUserTargetDate


        Adds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the
        flag's individual targeting.


        ##### Parameters


        * `flagKey`: The flag key

        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag

        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should
        remove the user from individual targeting for this flag.


        #### updateExpireUserTargetDate


        Updates the date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from
        the flag's individual targeting.


        ##### Parameters


        * `flagKey`: The flag key

        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag

        * `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should
        remove the user from individual targeting for this flag.

        * `version`: The version of the expiring user target to update. If
        included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of
        the expiring user target.


        #### removeExpireUserTargetDate


        Removes the scheduled removal of the user from the flag's individual
        targeting. The user will remain part of the flag's individual targeting
        until explicitly removed, or until another removal is scheduled.


        ##### Parameters


        * `flagKey`: The flag key

        * `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag

        ### Expanding the deployment collection response


        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the deployment collection response to
        include additional fields.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include
        the following:


        * `pullRequests` includes details on all of the pull requests associated
        with each deployment

        * `flagReferences` includes details on all of the references to flags in
        each deployment


        For example, use `?expand=pullRequests` to include the `pullRequests`
        field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the
        response.

        The deployment ID is returned as part of the [List
        deployments](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com) response. It is the `id`
        field of each element in the `items` array.


        ### Expanding the deployment response


        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the deployment response to include
        additional fields.

        For example, use `?expand=pullRequests` to include the `pullRequests`
        field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the
        response.

        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the flag event collection response to

        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include
        the following:


        * `experiments` includes details on all of the experiments run on each
        flag


        For example, use `?expand=experiments` to include the `experiments`
        field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the
        response.

        For example, use `?expand=scores` to include the `scores` field in the
        response. By default, this field is **not** included in the response.

        ### Expanding the pull request collection response


        LaunchDarkly supports expanding the pull request collection response to
        include additional fields.


        To expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and include
        the following:


        * `deployments` includes details on all of the deployments associated
        with each pull request

        * `flagReferences` includes details on all of the references to flags in
        each pull request

        * `leadTime` includes details about the lead time of the pull request
        for each stage


        For example, use `?expand=deployments` to include the `deployments`
        field in the response. By default, this field is **not** included in the
        response.
