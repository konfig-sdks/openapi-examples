      Profiles are containers for wearables data.

      The profiles can be seen as an extension of users in a different system.

      Profiles are anonymous objects which can participate in teams and
      challenges.


      Keep in mind, listing profiles and creating profiles need an
      administrative bearer token, all profile specific actions

      need a seperate bearer token that is returned after creating a profile.
      This bearer token is used in place of the

      administrative bearer token. (see profile create action for more
      information)

      WeFitter API’s challenge engine will bring endless engagement to your
      platform.

      For more information about the possibilities in challenges please go to
      https://www.wefitter.com/en-us/features/gamification/


      Challenges have multilanguage support on the fields: `Title`, `Slogan`,
      and `Description`.

      By default, challenges get the default-language that is configured in the
      app. Whenever a challenge is requested through the API this challenge will
      be presented in the default language. 

      If another language is preferred, this can be requested by adding the
      header parameter `Accept-Language` stating the language short code (ex.
      `en` for english). If this language short code is not present in the title
      of the challenge, the default language will be returned.


      These translation fields contain JSON strings, for example:

      ```{"en":"this is the English title","nl":"this is the Dutch title"}```

      So to create a multilanguage challenge, please provide the title, slogan,
      and description field as json strings, be aware that because of
      serialization this should be formed with backward slashes:



      <table><tbody>
          <tr><td>
      {


      "title": "{\"en\":\"this is the English title\", \"nl\":\"this is the
      dutch title\"}",


      "slogan": "{\"en\":\"this is the English title\", \"nl\":\"this is the
      dutch slogan\"}",


      "description": "{\"en\":\"this is the English title\", \"nl\":\"this is
      the dutch description\"}",


      }

      </td></tr>

      </tbody></table>

      Before any calls can be made to wefitter, BasicAuth is needed to verify
      the identity of the requesting party.

      This call will result into a Bearer token which has administrator
      privileges and is valid for 1 day.

      This token can be used to create profiles, challenges, etc.

      </p>


      <p>

      The returned bearer is a JWT (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token">JSON Web Token</a>).

        Creates a new profile.

        The bearer field contains a profile bearer token. When this is used in
        the Authorization header actions are performed

        as that profile, which will also enable access to private data.

        Using a profile bearer token disables administrative features such as
        creating profiles, making this token safe

        for 'public' use.

        A profile bearer token has no expiration, so it remains valid as long as
        the profile is active.
