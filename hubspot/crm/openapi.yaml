        Once you've defined an event template, it's likely that you'll want to
        define tokens for it as well. You can do this on the event template
        itself or update individual tokens here.


        Event type tokens allow you to attach custom data to events displayed in
        a timeline or used for list segmentation.


        You can also use `objectPropertyName` to associate any CRM object
        properties. This will allow you to fully build out CRM objects.


        Token names should be unique across the template.

        Event templates define the general structure for a custom timeline
        event. This includes formatted copy for its heading and details, as well
        as any custom property definitions. The event could be something like
        viewing a video, registering for a webinar, or filling out a survey. A
        single app can define multiple event templates.


        Event templates will be created for contacts by default, but they can be
        created for companies, tickets, and deals as well.


        Each event template contains its own set of tokens and `Markdown`
        templates. These tokens can be associated with any CRM object properties
        via the `objectPropertyName` field to fully build out CRM objects.


        You must create an event template before you can create events.
