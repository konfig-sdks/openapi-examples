      These endpoints are used for making and receiving SEPA credit transfers
      through the Mambu Payment Gateway.


      For more information on supported messages, flows and technical
      information, including examples of generated XML messages and how the
      fields map to these API requests, please refer to the [SEPA Credit
      Transfer](https://support.mambu.com/docs/sepa-credit-transfers) section of
      our User Guide.

  - description: >
      SEPA Direct Debit Payments are one time or recurring payments made using
      the Single European Payment Area scheme for transactions made in Euros
      between accounts at banks within the SEPA area, which includes all EU
      countries as well as other territories such as Liechtenstein, Switzerland,
      the United Kingdom, Andorra and Nordic countries.


      Mambu supports both the Core SEPA rulebook for individuals and the B2B
      scheme for companies. For more information on supported messages, flows
      and technical information, please refer to the [SEPA Direct
      Debit](https://support.mambu.com/docs/sepa-direct-debit) section of our
      user guide.

      These APIs allow you to submit inquiries for SEPA payments including for
      cases where the customer claims to have not received the funds, the value
      date was not correctly recorded or to request a status update for payments
      which have been cancelled.


      For more information on the types of inquiry supported and how to submit
      and respond to inquiries via the Mambu Payment Gateway UI, please refer to
      the relevant section of our User Guide, such as the [SEPA credit transfer
      inquiries](https://support.mambu.com/docs/sct-inquiries) article for SEPA
      credit transfers.

      The External Account Representation (EAR) endpoints are used to associate
      IBANs with Mambu account IDs so that payments made using the Mambu Payment
      Gateway are routed to the correct accounts.


      An IBAN can be mapped to multiple accounts but can only be associated to
      one account per currency, so, for example, the same IBAN can be mapped to
      one underlying Mambu account using EUR, another using GBP and another
      using CHF, but not to two accounts both in EUR denomination.


      <aside class='notice'><strong>Please Note</strong><br>There is a short
      delay for newly created accounts to be synced with the Mambu Payment
      Gateway. This means that requests to the EAR endpoints may fail with an
      <code>ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND</code> error if made immediately following account
      creation in Mambu. We recommend implementing a retry mechanism with
      exponential backoff and low value for maximum number of retries if such an
      error is received for an account which has just been created.</aside>

      If you are using an external service to check payments as part of your
      Anti Money Laundering obligations, these endpoints receive responses which
      will lead to unblocking funds and transferring them to the recipient
      account in the case of an all clear or returning funds to the payer in
      cases where there a compliance issue has been identified.


      For more general information on AML flows, including how the necessary
      suspense accounting should be set up in Mambu, please refer to the [AML

      This endpoint is the main entry point to the Mambu Payment Gateway for
      external systems.


      For more information on the types of messages accepted by this endpoint,
      please refer to the [supported

      <aside class="note">

      <strong>Please note</strong>

      <p>

      As this endpoint may be exposed to external systems, we strongly recommend
      using a separate API key for each service calling this API. This is an
      industry best practice and makes debugging easier, it also allows you to
      rotate or invalidate keys for a particular service in cases of system
      error or during security incidents.
