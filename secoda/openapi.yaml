  description: >
    Use this API to programmatically use Secoda's data enablement features. With
    these APIs, you can bring in resource metadata, build documentation
    pipelines, and manage workspace settings programmatically.


    To learn more about Secoda, visit the [Secoda
    documentation](https://docs.secoda.co/).


    To get in touch with Secoda, contact customer support at support@secoda.co.


    ## Getting Started


    ### Authentication


    Secoda API's require an Authorization header with a Bearer token. You can
    generate an API key in your workspace, as outlined
    [here](https://docs.secoda.co/secoda-api/authentication).


    ### Base URL


    To determine the base URL of your API requests, please refer to the chart
    below.


    | Workspace URL          | Base URL               |

    | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |

    | app.secoda.co          | api.secoda.co          |

    | eu.secoda.co           | eapi.secoda.co         |

    | apac.secoda.co         | aapi.secoda.co        |


    For teams with an On Premise or Managed instance with a custom domain, the
    Base URL is the custom domain followed by `/api/v1`.


    ## Helpful Information


    Secoda’s APIs generally follow the CRUD pattern (Create, Read, Update,
    Delete). The data elements that are managed with these APIs are called
    Resources. Generally, each resource maps to an integration, with many set
    and customizable properties called Metadata.


    ### Important Terminology


    **Workspace:**

    In Secoda, a workspace is the environment within the application where teams
    can integrate resources and metadata and add documentation, either through
    the UI or programatically through the API.


    **Resource:**

    In Secoda, a resource is any entity that metadata can be added to. This
    includes, but is not limited to, tables, dashboards, charts, columns,
    queries, documents, dictionary terms, and more.


    **Metadata:**

    In Secoda, metadata is the additional information you can provide to add
    context to your resources. This includes descriptions, definitions, owners,
    custom properties, and more. Metadata is the lifeblood of Secoda; the more
    you put in, the more you'll get out of the tool!


    ### Resource Heirarchy


    Nearly all resources in Secoda can be nested under a parent. A resource has
    a one to many relationship with its child. This means thats a parent
    resource can have several children, but a child resource can only have one
    parent.


    For Collections, Dictionary Terms, and Documents, the parent must be the
    same resource type. However, there are two unique heirarchy structures that
    the application expects when adding net new resources.


    **Table Heirarchy:** Integration > Databases > Schemas > Tables > Columns >
    Columns (if nested)


    **Dashboard Heirarchy:** Integration > Groups > Dashboards > Charts
