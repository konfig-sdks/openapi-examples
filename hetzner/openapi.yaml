    This is the official documentation for the Hetzner Cloud API.


    ## Introduction


    The Hetzner Cloud API operates over HTTPS and uses JSON as its data format.
    The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to
    specify requests and responses.


    As an alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to
    use:


    - Our CLI program [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)

    - Our [library for Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go)

    - Our [library for Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python)


    Also you can find a [list of libraries, tools, and integrations on
    GitHub](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud).


    If you are developing integrations based on our API and your product is Open
    Source you may be eligible for a free one time €50 (excl. VAT) credit on
    your account. Please contact us via the the support page on your Cloud
    Console and let us know the following:


    - The type of integration you would like to develop

    - Link to the GitHub repo you will use for the Project

    - Link to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have
    done so)


    ## Getting Started


    To get started using the API you first need an API token. Sign in into the
    [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go
    to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. Make sure to copy
    the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a
    Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a
    new token inside the Project. Let’s say your new token is
    `LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj`.


    You’re now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of
    all Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side
    using [curl](https://curl.se/).


    Make sure to replace the token in the example command with the token you
    have just created. Since your Project probably does not contain any Servers
    yet, the example response will look like the response on the right side. We
    will almost always provide a resource root like `servers` inside the example
    response. A response can also contain a `meta` object with information like
    [Pagination](https://docs.hetzner.cloud).


    **Example Request**


    ```bash

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer
    LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj" \
      https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers
    ```


    **Example Response**


    ```json

    {
      "servers": [],
      "meta": {
        "pagination": {
          "page": 1,
          "per_page": 25,
          "previous_page": null,
          "next_page": null,
          "last_page": 1,
          "total_entries": 0
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    ## Authentication


    All requests to the Hetzner Cloud API must be authenticated via a API token.
    Include your secret API token in every request you send to the API with the
    `Authorization` HTTP header.


    To create a new API token for your Project, switch into the [Hetzner Cloud
    Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security`
    → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token.


    **Example Authorization header**


    ```http

    Authorization: Bearer
    LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj

    ```


    ## Errors


    Errors are indicated by HTTP status codes. Further, the response of the
    request which generated the error contains an error code, an error message,
    and, optionally, error details. The schema of the error details object
    depends on the error code.


    The error response contains the following keys:


    | Keys      |
    Meaning                                                               |

    | --------- |
    --------------------------------------------------------------------- |

    | `code`    | Short string indicating the type of error
    (machine-parsable)          |

    | `message` | Textual description on what has gone
    wrong                            |

    | `details` | An object providing for details on the error (schema depends
    on code) |


    **Example response**


    ```json

    {
      "error": {
        "code": "invalid_input",
        "message": "invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long",
        "details": {
          "fields": [
            {
              "name": "broken_field",
              "messages": ["is too long"]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }

    ```

          ]
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    ## Labels


    Labels are `key/value` pairs that can be attached to all resources.


    Valid label keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated
    by a slash (`/`). The name segment is required and must be a string of 63
    characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character
    (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and
    alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must
    be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`), not
    longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).


    Valid label values must be a string of 63 characters or less and must be
    empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with
    dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.


    The `hetzner.cloud/` prefix is reserved and cannot be used.


    **Example Labels**


    ```json

    {
      "labels": {
        "environment": "development",
        "service": "backend",
        "example.com/my": "label",
        "just-a-key": ""
      }
    }

    ```


    ## Label Selector


    For resources with labels, you can filter resources by their labels using
    the label selector query language.


    | Expression           |
    Meaning                                              |

    | -------------------- |
    ---------------------------------------------------- |

    | `k==v` / `k=v`       | Value of key `k` does equal value
    `v`                |

    | `k!=v`               | Value of key `k` does not equal value
    `v`            |

    | `k`                  | Key `k` is
    present                                   |

    | `!k`                 | Key `k` is not
    present                               |

    | `k in (v1,v2,v3)`    | Value of key `k` is `v1`, `v2`, or
    `v3`              |

    | `k notin (v1,v2,v3)` | Value of key `k` is neither `v1`, nor `v2`, nor
    `v3` |

    | `k1==v,!k2`          | Value of key `k1` is `v` and key `k2` is not
    present |


    ### Examples


    - Returns all resources that have a `env=production` label and that don't
    have a `type=database` label:

      `env=production,type!=database`

    - Returns all resources that have a `env=testing` or `env=staging` label:

      `env in (testing,staging)`

    - Returns all resources that don't have a `type` label:

      `!type`

    ## Pagination


    Responses which return multiple items support pagination. If they do support
    pagination, it can be controlled with following query string parameters:


    - A `page` parameter specifies the page to fetch. The number of the first
    page is 1.

    - A `per_page` parameter specifies the number of items returned per page.
    The default value is 25, the maximum value is 50 except otherwise specified
    in the documentation.


    Responses contain a `Link` header with pagination information.


    Additionally, if the response body is JSON and the root object is an object,
    that object has a `pagination` object inside the `meta` object with
    pagination information:


    **Example Pagination**


    ```json

    {
        "servers": [...],
        "meta": {
            "pagination": {
                "page": 2,
                "per_page": 25,
                "previous_page": 1,
                "next_page": 3,
                "last_page": 4,
                "total_entries": 100
            }
        }
    }

    ```


    The keys `previous_page`, `next_page`, `last_page`, and `total_entries` may
    be `null` when on the first page, last page, or when the total number of
    entries is unknown.


    **Example Pagination Link header**


    ```http

    Link: <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=2&per_page=5>; rel="prev",
          <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=4&per_page=5>; rel="next",
          <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=6&per_page=5>; rel="last"
    ```


    Line breaks have been added for display purposes only and responses may only
    contain some of the above `rel` values.


    ## Rate Limiting


    All requests, whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate
    limiting. If you have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with
    a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses
    contain serveral headers which provide information about your current rate
    limit status.


    - The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests you can
    perform per hour.

    - The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the number of requests remaining
    in the current rate limit time frame.

    - The `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in
    time when your rate limit will have recovered and you will have the full
    number of requests available again.


    The default limit is 3600 requests per hour and per Project. The number of
    remaining requests increases gradually. For example, when your limit is 3600
    requests per hour, the number of remaining requests will increase by 1 every
    second.


    ## Server Metadata


    Your Server can discover metadata about itself by doing a HTTP request to
    specific URLs. The following data is available:


    | Data              | Format |
    Contents                                                     |

    | ----------------- | ------ |
    ------------------------------------------------------------ |

    | hostname          | text   | Name of the Server as set in the
    api                         |

    | instance-id       | number | ID of the
    server                                             |

    | public-ipv4       | text   | Primary public IPv4
    address                                  |

    | private-networks  | yaml   | Details about the private networks the Server
    is attached to |

    | availability-zone | text   | Name of the availability zone that Server
    runs in            |

    | region            | text   | Network zone, e.g.
    eu-central                                |

    ## Sorting


    Some responses which return multiple items support sorting. If they do
    support sorting the documentation states which fields can be used for
    sorting. You specify sorting with the `sort` query string parameter. You can
    sort by multiple fields. You can set the sort direction by appending `:asc`
    or `:desc` to the field name. By default, ascending sorting is used.


    **Example: Sorting**


    ```

    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status

    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc

    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:desc

    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc&sort=command:desc

    ```

      Floating IPs help you to create highly available setups. You can assign a
      Floating IP to any Server. The Server can then use this IP. You can
      reassign it to a different Server at any time, or you can choose to
      unassign the IP from Servers all together.


      Floating IPs can be used globally. This means you can assign a Floating IP
      to a Server in one Location and later reassign it to a Server in a
      different Location. For optimal routing and latency Floating IPs should be
      used in the Location they were created in.


      For Floating IPs to work with your Server, you must configure them inside
      your operation system.


      Floating IPs of type `ipv4` use a single IPv4 address as their `ip`
      property. Floating IPs of type `ipv6` use a /64 network such as
      `fc00::/64` as their `ip` property. Any IP address within that network can
      be used on your host.


      Floating IPs are billed on a monthly basis.

      they coexist with the public network that every Server has by default.


      They allow Servers to talk to each other over a dedicated network
      interface using private IP addresses not available publicly.


      The IP addresses are allocated and managed via the API, they must conform
      to [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918#section-3) standard. IPs
      and network interfaces defined under Networks do not provide public
      internet connectivity, you will need to use the already existing public
      network interface for that.


      Each network has a user selected `ip_range` which defines all available IP
      addresses which can be used for Subnets within the Network.


      To assign individual IPs to Servers you will need to create Network
      Subnets, described below.


      Currently Networks support IPv4 only.


      ### Subnets

      Subnets divide the `ip_range` from the parent Network object into multiple
      Subnetworks that you can use for different specific purposes.


      For each subnet you need to specify its own `ip_range` which must be
      contained within the parent Network’s `ip_range`. Additionally each subnet
      must belong to one of the available Network Zones described below. Subnets
      can not have overlapping IP ranges.


      Currently there are three types of subnet:

      * type `cloud` is used to connect cloud Resources into your Network.

      * type `server` was used to connect only cloud Servers into your Network.
      This type is deprecated and is replaced by type cloud.

      * type `vswitch` allows you to connect [Dedicated Server
      vSwitch](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch)
      - and all Dedicated Servers attached to it - into your Network


      Subnets of type `vswitch` must set a `vswitch_id` which is the ID of the
      existing vSwitch in Hetzner Robot that should be coupled.


      ### Network Zones

      Network Zones are groups of Locations which have special high-speed
      network connections between them. The [Location
      object](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#locations-get-a-location) contains the
      `network_zone` property each Location belongs to. Currently these network
      zones exist:


      |Network Zone|Contains Locations|

      |------------|------------------|

      |eu-central  | nbg1, fsn1, hel1 |

      |us-east     | ash              |

      |us-west     | hil              |


      ### IP address management

      When a cloud Server is attached to a network without the user specifying
      an IP it automatically gets an IP address assigned from a subnet of type
      `server` in the same network zone. If you specify the optional `ip`
      parameter when attaching then we will try to assign that IP. Keep in mind
      that the Server’s location must be covered by the Subnet’s Network Zone if
      you specify an IP, or that at least one Subnet with the zone covering
      Server’s location must exist.


      A cloud Server can also have more than one IP address in a Network by
      specifying aliases. For details see the [attach to network
      action](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#server-actions-attach-a-server-to-a-network).


      The following IP addresses are reserved in networks and can not be used:
        * the first IP of the network `ip_range` as it will be used as a default gateway for the private Network interface.
        * `172.31.1.1` as it is being used as default gateway for our public Network interfaces.

      ### Coupling Dedicated Servers


      By using subnets of type `vswitch` you can couple the Cloud Networks with
      an existing [Dedicated Server
      vSwitch](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch)
      and enable dedicated and cloud servers to

      talk to each other over the Network.

      In order for this to work the dedicated servers may only use IPs from the
      subnet and must have a special network configuration. Please refer to
      [FAQ](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/networks/connect-dedi-vswitch).
      vSwitch Layer 2 features are not supported.


      ### Routes

      Networks also support the notion of routes which are automatically applied
      to private traffic. A route makes sure that all packets for a given
      `destination` IP prefix will be sent to the address specified in its
      `gateway`.

      Placement groups are used to influence the location of interdependent
      virtual servers in our data centers. The distribution of the different
      instances within a group is based on a pattern specified in the type. By
      enforcing certain rules on the placement of instances within our
      infrastructure, availability can be influenced in a way that fits your
      needs best.


      In `spread` placement groups, all virtual servers will run on different
      physical servers. This decreases the probability that some instances might
      fail together.

      Primary IPs help you to create more flexible networking setups. You can
      assign at most one Primary IP of type `ipv4` and one of type `ipv6` per
      Server. This Server then uses these IPs.


      You can only unassign a Primary IP from a Server when it's powered off.
      This Primary IP can then be assigned to a different powered off Server, or
      you can keep it around for later use.


      Primary IPs are bound to a specific Datacenter. You can not assign a
      Primary IP from one Datacenter to a Server in a different Datacenter. If
      you need this capability use Floating IPs instead.


      If your Server's operating system supports cloud-init there is no further
      configuration needed to make Primary IPs work.


      Primary IPs of type `ipv4` use a single IPv4 address as their `ip`
      property. Primary IPs of type `ipv6` use a /64 network such as `fc00::/64`
      as their `ip` property. Any IP address within that network can be used on
      your host.


      Primary IPs are billed on an hourly basis.

      Images are blueprints for your VM disks. They can be of different types:


      ### System Images

      Distribution Images maintained by us, e.g. “Ubuntu 20.04”


      ### Snapshot Images

      Maintained by you, for example “Ubuntu 20.04 with my own settings”. These
      are billed per GB per month.


      ### Backup Images

      Daily Backups of your Server. Will automatically be created for Servers
      which have backups enabled (`POST /servers/{id}/actions/enable_backup`)


      Bound to exactly one Server. If you delete the Server, you also delete all
      backups bound to it. You may convert backup Images to snapshot Images to
      keep them.


      These are billed at 20% of your instance price for 7 backup slots.


      ### App Images

      Prebuild images with specific software configurations, e.g. “Wordpress”.
      All app images are created by us.

      Each Datacenter represents a *virtual* Datacenter which is made up of
      possible many physical Datacenters where Servers are hosted.


      Datacenter names are composed from their Location and virtual Datacenter
      number, for example `fsn1-dc14` means virtual Datacenter `14` in Location
      `fsn1`.


      Right now there is only one Datacenter for each Location. The Datacenter
      numbers for `fsn`, `nbg` and `hel` are arbitrarily set to `14`, `3` and
      `2` for historic reasons and do not represent real physical Hetzner
      datacenters.

      ISOs are read-only Images of DVDs. While we recommend using our Image
      functionality to install your Servers we also provide some stock ISOs so
      you can install more exotic operating systems by yourself.


      On request our support uploads a private ISO just for you. These are
      marked with type `private` and only visible in your Project.


      To attach an ISO to your Server use `POST
      /servers/{id}/actions/attach_iso`.

        The default type **uploaded** allows for uploading your existing
        `certificate` and `private_key` in PEM format. You have to monitor its
        expiration date and handle renewal yourself.


        In contrast, type **managed** requests a new Certificate from *Let's
        Encrypt* for the specified `domain_names`. Only domains managed by
        *Hetzner DNS* are supported. We handle renewal and timely alert the
        project owner via email if problems occur.


        For type `managed` Certificates the `action` key of the response
        contains the Action that allows for tracking the issuance process. For
        type `uploaded` Certificates the `action` is always null.

        Note that when updating labels, the Firewall's current set of labels
        will be replaced with the labels provided in the request body. So, for
        example, if you want to add a new label, you have to provide all
        existing labels plus the new label in the request body.


        Note: if the Firewall object changes during the request, the response
        will be a “conflict” error.

        labels will be replaced with the labels provided in the request body.
        So, for example, if you want to add a new label, you have to provide all
        existing labels plus the new label in the request body.

        You must specify the type of metric to get: `open_connections`,

        also specify more than one type by comma separation, e.g.
        `requests_per_second,bandwidth`.


        Depending on the type you will get different time series data:


        |Type | Timeseries | Unit | Description |

        |---- |------------|------|-------------|

        | open_connections | open_connections | number | Open connections |

        | connections_per_second | connections_per_second | connections/s |
        Connections per second |

        | requests_per_second | requests_per_second | requests/s | Requests per
        second |

        | bandwidth | bandwidth.in | bytes/s | Ingress bandwidth |

        || bandwidth.out | bytes/s | Egress bandwidth |


        Metrics are available for the last 30 days only.


        If you do not provide the step argument we will automatically adjust it
        so that 200 samples are returned.


        We limit the number of samples to a maximum of 500 and will adjust the

      summary: Change IP range of a Network
      operationId: NetworkActions_changeIpRange
      description: >
        Changes the IP range of a Network. IP ranges can only be extended and
        never shrunk. You can only add IPs at the end of an existing IP range.
        This means that the IP part of your existing range must stay the same
        and you can only change its netmask.


        For example if you have a range `10.0.0.0/16` you want to extend then
        your new range must also start with the IP `10.0.0.0`. Your CIDR netmask
        `/16` may change to a number that is smaller than `16` thereby
        increasing the IP range. So valid entries would be `10.0.0.0/15`,
        `10.0.0.0/14`, `10.0.0.0/13` and so on.


        After changing the IP range you will have to adjust the routes on your
        connected Servers by either rebooting them or manually changing the
        routes to your private Network interface.

        If you want to create a Primary IP that is not assigned to a Server, you
        need to provide the `datacenter` key instead of `assignee_id`. This can
        be either the ID or the name of the Datacenter this Primary IP shall be
        created in.


        Note that a Primary IP can only be assigned to a Server in the same
        Datacenter later on.

        A Server can only have one Primary IP of type `ipv4` and one of type
        `ipv6` assigned. If you need more IPs use Floating IPs.


        The Server must be powered off (status `off`) in order for this
        operation to succeed.

        Creates a new Server. Returns preliminary information about the Server
        as well as an Action that covers progress of creation.
      requestBody:
        description: >
          Please note that Server names must be unique per Project and valid
          hostnames as per RFC 1123 (i.e. may only contain letters, digits,
          periods, and dashes).


          For `server_type` you can either use the ID as listed in
          `/server_types` or its name.


          For `image` you can either use the ID as listed in `/images` or its
          name.


          If you want to create the Server in a Location, you must set
          `location` to the ID or name as listed in `/locations`. This is the
          recommended way. You can be even more specific by setting `datacenter`
          to the ID or name as listed in `/datacenters`. However we only
          recommend this if you want to assign a specific Primary IP to the
          Server which is located in the specified Datacenter.


          Some properties like `start_after_create` or `automount` will trigger
          Actions after the Server is created. Those Actions are listed in the
          `next_actions` field in the response.


          For accessing your Server we strongly recommend to use SSH keys by
          passing the respective key IDs in `ssh_keys`. If you do not specify
          any `ssh_keys` we will generate a root password for you and return it
          in the response.


          Please note that provided user-data is stored in our systems. While we
          take measures to protect it we highly recommend that you don’t use it
          to store passwords or other sensitive information.

        Attaches a Server to a network. This will complement the fixed public
        Server interface by adding an additional ethernet interface to the
        Server which is connected to the specified network.


        The Server will get an IP auto assigned from a subnet of type `server`
        in the same `network_zone`.


        Using the `alias_ips` attribute you can also define one or more
        additional IPs to the Servers. Please note that you will have to
        configure these IPs by hand on your Server since only the primary IP
        will be given out by DHCP.

        Server must be powered off for this command to succeed.


        This copies the content of its disk, and starts it again.


        You can only migrate to Server types with the same `storage_type` and
        equal or bigger disks. Shrinking disks is not possible as it might
        destroy data.


        If the disk gets upgraded, the Server type can not be downgraded any
        more. If you plan to downgrade the Server type, set `upgrade_disk` to
        `false`.

      description: >
        Creates an Image (snapshot) from a Server by copying the contents of its
        disks. This creates a snapshot of the current state of the disk and
        copies it into an Image. If the Server is currently running you must
        make sure that its disk content is consistent. Otherwise, the created
        Image may not be readable.


        To make sure disk content is consistent, we recommend to shut down the
        Server prior to creating an Image.


        You can either create a `backup` Image that is bound to the Server and
        therefore will be deleted when the Server is deleted, or you can create
        a `snapshot` Image which is completely independent of the Server it was
        created from and will survive Server deletion. Backup Images are only
        available when the backup option is enabled for the Server. Snapshot
        Images are billed on a per GB basis.

        Metrics are available for the last 30 days only.


        If you do not provide the step argument we will automatically adjust it
        so that a maximum of 200 samples are returned.


        We limit the number of samples returned to a maximum of 500 and will
        adjust the step parameter accordingly.

      operationId: Volumes_createVolume
      description: >
        Creates a new Volume attached to a Server. If you want to create a
        Volume that is not attached to a Server, you need to provide the
        `location` key instead of `server`. This can be either the ID or the
        name of the Location this Volume will be created in. Note that a Volume
        can be attached to a Server only in the same Location as the Volume
        itself.


        Specifying the Server during Volume creation will automatically attach
        the Volume to that Server after it has been initialized. In that case,
        the `next_actions` key in the response is an array which contains a
        single `attach_volume` action.


        The minimum Volume size is 10GB and the maximum size is 10TB (10240GB).


        A volume’s name can consist of alphanumeric characters, dashes,
        underscores, and dots, but has to start and end with an alphanumeric
        character. The total length is limited to 64 characters. Volume names
        must be unique per Project.

                        `2001:db8:ff00:42::8329/128`.

                        Use `0.0.0.0/0` to allow any IPv4 addresses and `::/0`
                        to allow any IPv6 addresses.

                      in [CIDR block notation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/CIDR).
                      You can specify 100 CIDR

                      blocks at most.


                      The CIDR blocks may refer to networks (with empty host
                      bits) or single hosts.

                      For example, a network could be defined with `10.0.1.0/24`
                      or `2001:db8:ff00:42::/64`,

                      `2001:db8:ff00:42::8329/128`.

                      Use `0.0.0.0/0` to allow any IPv4 addresses and `::/0` to
                      allow any IPv6 addresses.

                      You can specify 100 CIDR

                      blocks at most.


                      The CIDR blocks may refer to networks (with empty host
                      bits) or single hosts.

                      For example, a network could be defined with `10.0.1.0/24`
                      or `2001:db8:ff00:42::/64`,

                      `2001:db8:ff00:42::8329/128`.

                      Use `0.0.0.0/0` to allow any IPv4 addresses and `::/0` to
                      allow any IPv6 addresses.

                      in [CIDR block notation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/CIDR).
                      You can specify 100 CIDR

                      blocks at most.


                      The CIDR blocks may refer to networks (with empty host
                      bits) or single hosts.

                      For example, a network could be defined with `10.0.1.0/24`
                      or `2001:db8:ff00:42::/64`,

                      and a single host with `10.0.1.1/32` or
                      `2001:db8:ff00:42::8329/128`.

                      Use `0.0.0.0/0` to allow any IPv4 addresses and `::/0` to
                      allow any IPv6 addresses.
