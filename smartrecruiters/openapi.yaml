            page identifier of elements to return


            The `pageId` param can be used to fetch multiple page response, in
            case

            the number of results is higher than max number of elements to
            return (specified in the `limit` parameter).

            The `pageId` should not be present when requesting the first page of
            results.

            The pageId of the following page is returned either in the
            `nextPageId` property, or is available

            in the HTTP header `Link` value of relation type `next`.

            Example of the `Link` header:

            ```

        **Tracking candidate source**


        When adding a new candidate, it's very important you track its source
        appropriately. In order to associate a source with your app/integration,
        add below object to a candidate body object for this endpoint:

        ```

        {
          "sourceDetails": {
            "sourceTypeId": "string",
            "sourceSubTypeId": "string",
            "sourceId": "string"
          }
        }

        ```

        **sourceTypeId** - it's a Source Type - available values can be found
        using [get
        /configuration/sources](https://developers.smartrecruiters.com/reference/configurationsourcetypes-1)
        endpoint


        **sourceSubTypeId** - it's a Source Subtype, an optional parameter -
        available values can be found using [get
        /configuration/sources](https://developers.smartrecruiters.com/reference/configurationsourcetypes-1)
        endpoint


        **sourceId** - it's a Source Id - available values for a given
        sourceTypeId can be found using [get
        /configuration/sources/:sourceTypeId/values](https://developers.smartrecruiters.com/reference/configurationsourcevaluesall-1)
        endpoint


        NOTE: Not defining the source will default to **API** source.


        NOTE II: In case you can't find an appropriate source to track against
        you can:

        * Create a custom source for each customer account separately on [this
        admin
        page](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/settings/configuration/custom-sources)
        (you need to be logged in as an admin to the customer account in order
        to view this page)

        * Request to
        [partners@smartrecruiters.com](mailto:partners@smartrecruiters.com)
        adding a standard source that will be available for all customers if
        your app/integration is productised (available to all SmartRecruiters
        customers)

        Depending on the consent approach which a customer chooses, the response
        will either contain one candidates'

        consent decision - known as "single consent" - or contain one
        candidates' consent broken out by the data scopes

        which the customer has subscribed to - such as SmartRecruit and
        SmartCRM. This is referred to as "separated consent".

        Provided there is at least one pending consent request (without a
        decision) for a candidate, the response

        contains a date and time of the most recent of such consent requests.

        **Tracking candidate source**


        When adding a new candidate, it's very important you track its source
        appropriately. In order to associate a source with your app /
        integration, add the below object to a candidate body object for this
        endpoint:

        ```

        {
          "sourceDetails": {
            "sourceTypeId": "string",
            "sourceSubTypeId": "string",
            "sourceId": "string"
          }
        }

        ```

        **sourceTypeId** - it's a Source Type - available values can be found
        using [get
        /configuration/sources](https://developers.smartrecruiters.com/reference/configurationsourcetypes-1)
        endpoint


        **sourceSubTypeId** - it's a Source Subtype, an optional parameter -
        available values can be found using [get
        /configuration/sources](https://developers.smartrecruiters.com/reference/configurationsourcetypes-1)
        endpoint


        **sourceId** - it's a Source Id - available values for a given
        sourceTypeId can be found using [get
        /configuration/sources/:sourceTypeId/values](https://developers.smartrecruiters.com/reference/configurationsourcevaluesall-1)
        endpoint


        NOTE: Not defining the source will default to **API** source.


        NOTE II: In case you can't find an appropriate source to track against
        you can:

        * Create a custom source for each customer account separately on [this
        admin
        page](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/settings/configuration/custom-sources\)
        (you need to be logged in as an admin to the customer account in order
        to view this page)

        * Request to
        [partners@smartrecruiters.com](mailto:partners@smartrecruiters.com)
        adding a standard source that will be available for all customers if
        your app / integration is productised (available to all SmartRecruiters
        customers)

        * @-mention users to send them an email
          * In **content** field use **@[USER:id]** to mention a User, e.g. @[USER:324132421]
        * Email responses are added as comments to your update

        * \#-tag candidates to link updates to their profiles
          * In **content** field use **#[CANDIDATE:id]** to tag a candidate, e.g. #[CANDIDATE:9847954623]
        * Use **shareWith** to share a feed update with individuals, hiring
        teams or everyone
          * In **users** field, provide an array of User IDs with which you want to share, e.g. "users": ["12343542356","12343542357"].
          * In **hiringTeamOf** field, provide an array of Job IDs, this will share message with a full hiring team of those jobs, e.g. "hiringTeamOf": ["123423432322","123423432324"].
          * **everyone** flag allows sharing with everyone in a company. If not provided, defaults to **false**.
          * **openNote** flag allows sharing with everyone in a company that has access to the candidate. If not provided, defaults to **false**

        To ensure that target server is ready to consume notifications, we
        require you to implement the initial

        handshake.


        Having subscription with `callbackUrl`: `https://example.org/hook`,
        during activation we will make `POST`

        request with `X-Hook-Secret` header:


        ```

        POST https://example.com/hook

        X-Hook-Secret: 4jn8fs9011jj8

        ```


        We expect your server to respond within the time of 20 seconds with HTTP
        `200` response containing

        `X-Hook-Secret` header with same value.


        ```

        Response 200

      description: >
        We allow you to generate a secret key for the subscription. You can use
        it to verify the author of callback messages. When you

        have a secret key already defined - a creation of new one will make old
        one deprecated - it will be still active for 24 hours

        though. You can have up to 16 non-expired secret keys.


        A signature will be included in header `smartrecruiters-signature` of
        callback request. Additionally we will send

        `smartrecruiters-timestamp` header with timestamp (seconds) of request.


        `smartrecruiters-signature` header value has the following format:


        ```

        $SIGNATURE_SCHEMA=$SIGNATURE_1;$SIGNATURE_SCHEMA=$SIGNATURE_2...

        ```


        As you may notice there may be multiple signatures included in the
        header. It can be caused by one or both:

        * having multiple active keys

        * smartrecruiters providing multiple signatures per key with different
        signature schemes. We may use it in the

        future to deliver new algorithm of signature creation without breaking
        backward compability.

        Every segment of header value is delimited by `;` character


        Currently, we support and sent following signature
        (`$SIGNATURE_SCHEMA`):


        #### 1) `v1`


        Signature calculated using HMAC with SHA256 algorithm. Hash should be
        calculated from following elements

        concatenated by the `.` character:
          * `smartrecruiters-timestamp` header value
          * request body
          * `event-id` header value
          * `event-name` header value
          * `event-version` header value
          * `link` header value

        Order of this elements is important. In absence of header please use an
        empty string as its value.


        For example assume we have:

        * One active secret key: HeBVky2bccvvkcXPimH8c

        * Callback request:
          * headers:
            * content-type: application/json
            * smartrecruiters-signature: "v1=2e9291f10d44ca10204a4cd81b05d73b6a316b2b605d4e2e0e0b37b40198ce1f"
            * smartrecruiters-timestamp = "1574080897"
            * event-id = "123"
            * link = "<http://smartrecruiters.com/endpoint>; rel=self"
            * event-name = "application.created"
            * event-version = "v201910"
          * body: {"job_id":"jid","candidate_id": "cid"}

        hash should be calculated from value:

        ```

        1574080897.{"job_id":"jid","candidate_id":"cid"}.123.application.created.v201910.<http://smartrecruiters.com/endpoint>;
        rel=self

        ```


        and after using HMAC and SHA256 it should give you hash :
        2e9291f10d44ca10204a4cd81b05d73b6a316b2b605d4e2e0e0b37b40198ce1f,


        so that `smartrecruiters-signature` header in the callback request will
        have value:

        `v1=2e9291f10d44ca10204a4cd81b05d73b6a316b2b605d4e2e0e0b37b40198ce1f`
