        CUSIP stands for `Committee on Uniform Securities Identification

        A CUSIP number identifies most financial instruments, including: stocks
        of all registered U.S. and Canadian companies, commercial paper, and
        U.S. government and municipal bonds.

        The CUSIP system facilitates the clearance and settlement process of
        securities.

        CUSIP numbers consist of nine characters (including letters and numbers)
        that uniquely identify a company or issuer and the type of financial
        instrument.

        A similar system is used to identify foreign securities (`CUSIP
        International Numbering System or CINS`).

        CINS employs the same nine character identifier as CUSIP, but also
        contains a letter in the first position to signify the issuer's country
        or geographic region.
