  title: Resistant Documents API
  description: >-

    Resistant Documents provides this API to programmatically interact with its
    document analysis engine.

    Interaction with the API can be divided into three phases:


    1. Creating document submission

    2. Uploading a file for for analysis to an address returned from step 1.

    3. Fetching analysis results


    In the first step, the submission is created by posting to the 
    `/v2/submission` endpoint. The response contains a `submission_id` uniquely
    identifying the document to be analyzed throughout the entire interaction,
    and is used to fetch analysis results later.


    Submission response also returns `upload_url` containing a pre-signed URL.
    This URL should be used to upload the actual document to be analyzed in the
    second step. Please note the document has to be uploaded using HTTP `PUT`
    method with `Content-Type` HTTP header set to `application/octet-stream`.


    In the last step, client should repeatedly poll using the
    `/v2/submission/{submission_id}/fraud` endpoint for analysis results. The
    best practice is to use polling with an [exponential
    back-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) to reduce load
    on the API.

        characteristics are properties associated with the <i>original</i>
        submission of the document (i.e., from the end user).

        In descriptions of the properties, "user" refers to the person who
        initially submitted the document, "customer" refers to a customer of
        Resistant.ai using this API.


        Calling this endpoint is only allowed if
        `enable_submission_characteristics` is set to `true` when creating the
        submission. When submission characteristics are enabled for the
        submission, submitting then is <b>required</b> (the document will not be
        analyzed without them).

          description: >-
            Overall score of analyzed sample. A TRUSTED score is attributed to
            documents where the system has identified a reason to trust them. A
            NORMAL score describes the documents where the system has no
            particular reason to trust or distrust them. A WARNING score is
            given to documents that are identified as more likely to have been
            modified, such as scanned documents. A HIGH_RISK score identifies
            the documents where the system has identified modifications that are
            frequently associated with fraud or forgery attempts.

        flow:


        1. Client makes a
        [request](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#request-for-token)
        to authorization server using client credentials

        ```

        BASIC_AUTH=$(echo -n $CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET | base64)

        curl --request POST \
          --url 'https://eu.id.resistant.ai/oauth2/aus2un1hkrKhPjir4417/v1/token' \
          --header 'accept: application/json' \
          --header "authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH" \
          --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
          --data 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=submissions.read submissions.write'
        ```

        2. If the credentials are valid, authorization server responds with an
        access token

        ```

        {
          "access_token": "eyJhbG[...]1LQ",
          "token_type": "Bearer",
          "expires_in": 3600,
          "scope": "submissions.read submissions.write"
        }

        ```

        3. Client uses the access token to make subsequent API requests with
        Authorization header

        ```

        Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG[...]1LQ

        ```

        URL is in the corresponding environment documentation.
