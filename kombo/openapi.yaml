    Kombo is changing how B2B SaaS companies provide HR integrations to their
    customers. Instead of having to build and maintain many APIs themselves,
    Kombos customers can integrate with Kombo's API once and offer dozens of
    APIs to their customers instantly.

        At Kombo we put a lot of work into making sure that our unified API
        covers all our customers' use cases and that they never have to think
        about integration-specific logic again. There are cases, however, where
        our customers want to build features that are very integration-specific.
        That's where this endpoint comes in.


        Pass in details about the request you want to make to the integration's
        API and we'll forward it for you. We'll also take care of setting the
        right base URL and authenticating your requests.


        To get started, please pick the relevant API (some tools provide
        multiple to due different base URLs or authentication schemes) from the
        table below and pass in the `{tool}/{api}` identifier as part of the
        path.


        |Integration|`{tool}/{api}`|Description|

        |---|---|---|

        |Personio|`personio/personnel`|Personio's [Personnel Data
        API](https://developer.personio.de/reference/get_company-employees). We
        automatically authenticate all requests using the client ID and secret
        and use `https://api.personio.de/v1` as the base URL.|

        |Workday|`workday/soap`|[Workday's SOAP
        API](https://community.workday.com/sites/default/files/file-hosting/productionapi/index.html).
        We automatically authenticate all requests. Set `data` to your raw xml
        string. Use `/` as your `path`, as we will always send requests to
        `https://{domain}/ccx/service/{tenant}/{service_name}/38.2`. Set your
        `method` to `POST`. You need to specify the `api_options` object and set
        `service_name` to the name of the service you want to call. Find all
        available services
        [here](https://community.workday.com/sites/default/files/file-hosting/productionapi/versions/v41.0/index.html).
        The string that you submit as `data` will be the content of the
        `soapenv:Body` tag in the request.|

        |Lever|`lever/v1`|[Lever's v1
        API](https://hire.lever.co/developer/documentation). We automatically

        credentials by default).|

        |Recruitee|`recruitee/default`|The [Recruitee
        API](https://api.recruitee.com/docs/index.html). We automatically

        job board pages ([currently just the XML
        feed](https://developer.personio.de/reference/get_xml)). We
        automatically use the right `https://{company}.jobs.personio.de` base
        URL.|

        |BambooHR|`bamboohr/v1`|BambooHR's
        [API](https://documentation.bamboohr.com/reference/get-employee). We

        in mind, please reach out to Kombo.</Note>

        Create a link that will allow the user to reconnect an integration. This
        is useful if you want to allow your users to update the credentials if
        the old ones for example expired.


        Embed this the same way you would [embed the connect
        link](https://api.kombo.dev). By default, the link will be valid for 1
        hour.

        <Warning>
              **This endpoint is deprecated!**

              Please use [the `/groups` endpoint](https://api.kombo.dev) instead. It returns the same data but the naming makes more sense as the model not only includes teams but also departments and cost centers..
            </Warning>

        Top level filters use AND, while individual filters use OR if they
        accept multiple arguments. That means filters will be resolved like

      summary: Add result link to application
      operationId: UnifiedAtsApi_addResultLink
      description: >-
        Add a result link to an application.

        This can, for example, be used to link a candidate back to a test
        result/assessment in your application. As not all ATS tools have a
        "result link" feature, we sometimes repurpose other fields to expose it.


        <Note>
          This endpoint requires the permission **Create and manage candidates and applications** to be enabled in [your scope config](https://api.kombo.dev).

        You'd like to see this feature for another integration? Please reach
        out!

        We're always happy to discuss extending our coverage.

        </Accordion>


        <Warning>
              **This endpoint is deprecated!**

              We realized that in practice it was always more about creating _applications_ instead of _candidates_, so we created a new, more aptly named one that you should use instead: [Create application](https://api.kombo.dev)

              Using it also has the benefit that we return the newly created applicant at the root level, so you can easily store its ID.
            </Warning>

        <Note>
          This endpoint requires the permission **Create and manage candidates and applications** to be enabled in [your scope config](https://api.kombo.dev).
        </Note>

        You'd like to see this feature for another integration? Please reach
        out!

        We're always happy to discuss extending our coverage.

        </Accordion>


        <Warning>
              **This endpoint is deprecated!**

              Please use [add result link to application](https://api.kombo.dev) instead.
        This can, for example, be used to link a candidate back to a test
        result/assessment in your application. As not all ATS tools have a
        "result link" feature, we sometimes repurpose other fields to expose it.


        This action is deprecated because result links usually concern
        applications and not candidates. Use endpoint nested under
        `/applications` instead..
            </Warning>

        <Note>
          This endpoint requires the permission **Create and manage candidates and applications** to be enabled in [your scope config](https://api.kombo.dev).

        <Warning>
              **This endpoint is deprecated!**

              Get all application stages available in the ATS. This is deprecated because most ATS systems have separate sets of stages for each job. We'd recommend using the `stages` property on jobs instead..
            </Warning>

        Top level filters use AND, while individual filters use OR if they
        accept multiple arguments. That means filters will be resolved like

        This endpoint is used to ensure users can't trick your system connecting
        their

        account in your system to another customers integration. You don't get

        token used

        for this endpoint so that users can't send you arbitrary data that you
        would put

        into your system.

                    Please be aware that including this in you scope config
                    might violate other

                    scopes that are set.


                    Remote data always has the endpoint path that we got the
                    data from as the

                    top level key. For example, it could look like: `{
                    "/companies": { ... }}`
                        
                    This is not available on all plans. Reach out to Kombo if

                          board

                          itself

                          - `UNLISTED`: anyone can apply but only if they have
                          the link to it

                          - `CONFIDENTIAL`: nobody can apply and it's only
                          visible in the ATS to people who were invited to it

                          post public open jobs of your customers/partners.

                                Please be aware that including this in you scope

                                Remote data always has the endpoint path that we

                                top level key. For example, it could look like:
                                `{ "/companies": { ... }}`

                    Please be aware that including this in you scope config
                    might violate other

                    scopes that are set.


                    Remote data always has the endpoint path that we got the
                    data from as the

                    top level key. For example, it could look like: `{
                    "/companies": { ... }}`
                        
                    This is not available on all plans. Reach out to Kombo if
                    you need it.
