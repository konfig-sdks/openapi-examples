    # Rate limits


    Wallester has no rate limits and allows sending an unlimited number of
    requests to API, but we reserve the right to impose such limits if
    necessary.


    # RSA keys


    Encrypted card data exchange schema:

    ![Encrypted card data exchange
    schema](img/encrypted-card-data-exchange-schema.png)

    Public key needed in the request might be programmed to be generated and
    encrypted on each request or prepared in advance as given in the examples
    below and updated periodically.

    It is recommended to use length of at least 3076 bytes when keys are being
    generated.


    ## Generating RSA keys


    RSA key pair can be generated using following command:


    ```shell


    openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 4096

    openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem


    ```

      ## Introduction


      This document describes how the **Client** can integrate with the
      **Wallester** system to receive events in real-time and do custom business
      logic in **Client’s** system based on the received data.


      **Wallester** sends events using
      [Webhooks](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/guides/what-are-webhooks-how-they-work#consuming-a-webhook)
      based communication, where **Client** has an HTTP server and **Wallester**
      acts as a client. **Wallester** does a HTTP POST request to a URL of
      **Client** choice in a JSON format.


      Along with the event, data about the object is transferred, which is
      referred to as the payload. The payload can be extended with new optional
      fields at any time, therefore **Client** should be able to receive and
      process fields of any type and not add strict validation.


      ## Communication Format


      To use the **Wallester** notification system, **Client** must share the
      following information:

      1. Basic authentication credentials (Username & Password)

      2. HTTP server URL

      3. Type of events to be enabled


      ## HTTP


      HTTP requests are protected with HTTP Basic authentication. To
      unauthenticated requests, the external system should return a response
      with a HTTP 401 Unauthorized status.


      ![Request-response scheme](img/request-response.png)


      The **Client** needs to whitelist the **Wallester** IP addresses in order
      to allow requests to pass through the firewall.


      **Production:**

      - Contact our Support team
      [support@wallester.com](mailto:support@wallester.com)


      **Sandbox:**

      - Contact our Support team
      [support@wallester.com](mailto:support@wallester.com)


      ## Guaranteed delivery


      Notifications can be configured with guaranteed delivery feature.
      Notification will be sent again in case of an unexpected response status
      code (not HTTP code 200) or a timeout for any of the involved notification
      types, the Retry logic will apply.


      The feature is available for the following Notification Event types:


      - Authorization notification

      - Create card

      - Fee

      - Authorization release

      - Transaction clearing

      - KYC Check

      - Person KYC status change (new format)

      - Apple pay orange flow notifications


      **Retry logic:**


      <table>

      <tr><th>Retry</th><th>Approximate time after the first failure</th></tr>

      <tr><td>1st retry</td><td>2 seconds</td></tr>

      <tr><td>2nd retry</td><td>5 seconds</td></tr>

      <tr><td>3rd retry</td><td>10 seconds</td></tr>

      <tr><td>4th retry</td><td>10 minutes</td></tr>

      <tr><td>5th retry</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr>

      <tr><td>6th retry</td><td>1 hour</td></tr>

      <tr><td>7th retry</td><td>3 hours</td></tr>

      <tr><td>8th retry</td><td>6 hours</td></tr>

      <tr><td>9th retry</td><td>12 hours</td></tr>

      <tr><td>10th retry</td><td>24 hours</td></tr>

      </table>


      Depending on the technical requirements, a specific message delivery type
      should be chosen:

      1. **Limited** - events will be retried 10 times only; retry logic
      intervals are applied;

      2. **Mandatory** - events will be retried until Wallester receives a
      successful response; retry logic intervals are applied; after the 10th try
      message will be resent every 24 hours.


      The diagram below is given for the visual flow representation:


      ![Diagram of Notification Sending
      Process](img/send-notifications-diagram.png)


      ## Events


      ### 1. Authorization


      Given events allows the Client to receive information for all card related
      authorizations and binded notifications, initiated by Cardholder or
      Merchant. Intent of such notifications is purely informative.


      1.1. [Authorization](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      1.2. [Reversal authorization](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      1.3. [Release authorization](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      ### 1.4. Decision request


      Following events might be used in case when **Client** would like to get
      access to authorization approval logic. There are a few specific decision
      requests: Balance Inquiry and Partial payment. Those require more advanced
      behavior than regular payment authorizations.


      Due to strict card schema requirements, a response must be sent back to
      **Wallester** within 1 second or less.


      If **Client** does not reply within the expected period or there are any
      communication issues between **Client** and **Wallester** (unresolvable
      within a given time), **Wallester** will use **default behavior defined by
      Client** (approve or decline).


      1.4.1. [Decision request: Authorization](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      1.4.2. [Decision request: Balance inquiry
      authorization](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      1.4.3. [Decision request: Partial
      Authorization](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      #### Response codes


      This section describes all possible response codes that can be used in
      response to a decision request. It is strongly recommended to use all
      available options and return the correct reason for each decision.


      <table><tr><th>Response
      Code</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Approved</td><td>Approve.</td></tr><tr><td>ApprovedForPartialAmount</td><td>Approve
      for a partial amount. See Partial authorization for more
      details.</td></tr><tr><td>ClientSystemMalfunction</td><td>Client system is
      experiencing
      downtime.</td></tr><tr><td>DeclinedByClient</td><td>Decline.</td></tr><tr><td>DoNotHonour</td><td>Decline
      due to potential fraud or other system
      rules.</td></tr><tr><td>NotSufficientFunds</td><td>Insufficient funds on
      the cardholder
      balance.</td></tr><tr><td>TransactionNotPermittedToCardholder</td><td>Payment
      not allowed for the cardholder.</td></tr></table>


      ### 2. Transaction


      2.1. [Transaction clearing](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      ### 3. Account adjustment


      3.1. [Incoming payment](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      ### 4. Fee


      Fee types and events are configured in the Wallester system, which makes
      it possible to configure notifications only for a specific fee or event
      type. Only a complete event is available at the moment.


      Possible event types:

      - **create** (Event notification is triggered when a new fee is created,
      except one that is created in Completed status and is not related to
      authorization.)

      - **update** (Event notification is triggered when a fee amount changes.
      For example, during clearing the amount is recalculated.)

      - **cancel** (Event notification is triggered when a fee is canceled. For
      example, the authorization has expired and related fee is canceled)

      - **complete** (Event notification is triggered when a new fee is created
      in Completed status or fee status has changed to Completed. For example,
      the CardIssuanceFee is created in Completed status or fee status has
      changed to Completed after clearing.)


      4.1. [Complete fee](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      4.2. [Create fee](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      4.3. [Update fee](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      4.4. [Cancel fee](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      ### 5. Tokenization


      5.1. Apple pay incentive notifications

       5.1.2. [Apple Pay incentive notification successful transaction](https://api-doc.wallester.com)

      5.2. [Apple pay orange flow](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      ### 6. Person


      6.1. [KYC status change](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      ### 7. Card


      Card lifecycle representation:


      ![Card lifecycle representation](img/card-lifecycle-representation.png)


      7.1. [Create card](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      7.2. [Ordered card](https://api-doc.wallester.com)

      7.6. [Block card](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      7.7. Close card


      Event notification is triggered when a new card is closed. The status is
      applicable for all card types.

      - 7.7.1. [Closing](https://api-doc.wallester.com)

      - 7.7.2. [Closed](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      7.8. [Expire card](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      7.9. [Renew card](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      ### 8. 3D Secure


      8.1. [Event notification is triggered when a new 3DS OTP request is
      received. By default, the message is sent to the cardholder via SMS,
      however when this event is enabled, the message will be forwarded to a
      server defined by the Client instead.](https://api-doc.wallester.com)


      8.2. 3D secure authentication


      **Currently, this topic only implies Out of Band authentication. This is
      the initial version that can be modified in the future, therefore make
      sure to not add strict validation.**


      1. **Wallester** will send the [Initiate
      Action](https://api-doc.wallester.com) event to Client, providing
      information about cardholder and purchase.


      2. **Client** will send a notification to the cardholder’s device to wake
      the mobile application.


      3. Cardholder will authenticate within **Client** App (via out of band).


      4. **Wallester** will send the [Validate](https://api-doc.wallester.com)
      event to the **Client** asking for the results (this recurs every 2
      seconds after each Pending Status is received).


      5. **Client** will verify whether the cardholder has confirmed the
      purchase.


      **Wallester** expects to receive response from **Client** in less than 500
      ms per each event.

        There are two options for notifications:


        1. Send notification only for cards which are created with
        send_notification flag set to true. API documentation:
        https://api-doc.wallester.com/#operation/CreateCard


        2. Send notifications for all cards created in the system. There is no
        need to send flag through the API in this case.

        Partial authorizations might be available for the various authorization
        types, depending on merchant type and its capabilities to support
        partial approvals. Nevertheless, a good sample of conditions where
        partial payments apply might be authorization with the type
        **AutomatedFuelDispenser**. Conditions when partial payments might be
        allowed or declined fully depending on Client’s regulations.


        For example, in case when a cardholder has less money on account than
        requested via authorization, the Client might freeze the available
        amount and respond with the response code **ApprovedForPartialAmount**.
        In such cases an **approved_amount** is expected in response, where the
        **approved_amount** - amount of money that will be frozen on the
        cardholder's account.


        In case when a cardholder has enough funds on account on
        **AutomatedFuelDispenser**, authorization response code is set to
        **Approved**, which means the full amount was available and frozen on
        account.


        In case of **Wallester** declining authorization for any reason, the
        **Client** will receive an appropriate notification event with the
        information on the declined request.

        Authorization transfers funds from the available amount to the blocked
        amount, while the money remains in the account. Banks usually hold funds
        for 7-14 days. Funds are physically transferred at the time of the
        transaction. If the transaction did not occur on time, then the funds
        are returned from the blocked amount to the available amount. This is
        called "release authorization". "Release authorization" can occur for
        several reasons, for example, due to a technical error or due to the
        fault of the merchant who did not send the transaction on time.

      description: >-
        Programs using times should typically store and pass them as values,

        not pointers. That is, time variables and struct fields should be of

        type time.Time, not *time.Time.


        A Time value can be used by multiple goroutines simultaneously except

        that the methods GobDecode, UnmarshalBinary, UnmarshalJSON and

        UnmarshalText are not concurrency-safe.


        Time instants can be compared using the Before, After, and Equal
        methods.

        The Sub method subtracts two instants, producing a Duration.

        The Add method adds a Time and a Duration, producing a Time.


        The zero value of type Time is January 1, year 1, 00:00:00.000000000
        UTC.

        As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, the IsZero method gives

        a simple way of detecting a time that has not been initialized
        explicitly.


        Each Time has associated with it a Location, consulted when computing
        the

        presentation form of the time, such as in the Format, Hour, and Year
        methods.

        The methods Local, UTC, and In return a Time with a specific location.

        Changing the location in this way changes only the presentation; it does
        not

        change the instant in time being denoted and therefore does not affect
        the

        computations described in earlier paragraphs.


        Representations of a Time value saved by the GobEncode, MarshalBinary,

        MarshalJSON, and MarshalText methods store the Time.Location's offset,
        but not

        the location name. They therefore lose information about Daylight Saving
        Time.


        In addition to the required “wall clock” reading, a Time may contain an
        optional

        reading of the current process's monotonic clock, to provide additional
        precision

        for comparison or subtraction.

        See the “Monotonic Clocks” section in the package documentation for
        details.


        Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but also
        the

        Location and the monotonic clock reading. Therefore, Time values should
        not

        be used as map or database keys without first guaranteeing that the

        identical Location has been set for all values, which can be achieved

        through use of the UTC or Local method, and that the monotonic clock
        reading

        has been stripped by setting t = t.Round(0). In general, prefer
        t.Equal(u)

        to t == u, since t.Equal uses the most accurate comparison available and

        correctly handles the case when only one of its arguments has a
        monotonic

        clock reading.
