            The default value is `false`. If you set it to `true`, you can use

        * A meeting's `start_url` value is the URL a host or an alternative host

        * For `custCreate` meeting hosts (users created with the `custCreate`
        parameter via the [**Create

        **Note:** 


        For security reasons, the recommended way to programmatically get the
        updated `start_url` value after expiry is to call the [**Get a

        to the `start_url` value in the response.

        Branding](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4836268732045-Using-Webinar-Session-Branding)

        setting a webinar wallpaper that displays behind video tiles. Session
        branding also lets hosts set the Virtual Background for and apply name
        tags to hosts, alternative hosts, panelists, interpreters, and
        speakers.

            GMT formats. 

            * To set a meeting's start time in GMT, use the
            `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ` date-time format. For example,
            `2020-03-31T12:02:00Z`. 

            * To set a meeting's start time using a specific timezone, use the

            ID](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/other-references/abbreviation-lists/#timezones)
            in the `timezone` field. If you do not specify a timezone, the
            `timezone` value defaults to your Zoom account's timezone. You can
            also use `UTC` for the `timezone` value.

            **Note:** If no `start_time` is set for a scheduled meeting, the
            `start_time` is set at the current time and the meeting type changes
            to an instant meeting, which expires after 30 days.

             **Note:** if you use `next_page_token` as a parameter, your other request parameters should be changeless to make sure that the large result set is what you want. For example, if your `to` parameter is for a future time, Zoom resets this value to the current time and returns this value in the response body, along with the `next_page_token` value. Use these same `to` and `next_page_token` values in requests for the remaining results set; otherwise you will get an invalid token error.

                For example, for a meeting to recur on 23rd of each month,
                provide `23` as this field's value and `1` as the

            Each meeting instance generates its own meeting UUID. After a
            meeting ends, a new UUID is generated for the next instance of the
            meeting.

             Use the [**List past meeting instances**](https://developers.zoom.us) API to retrieve a list of UUIDs from past meeting instances. [Double encode](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/using-zoom-apis/#meeting-id-and-uuid) your UUID when using it for API calls if the UUID begins with a `/` or contains `//` in it.
