  description: >
    # Introduction


    Welcome to Affinity API v2! This API provides a RESTful interface for
    building internal apps,

    automated workflows, and other integrations on top of the core data models
    in Affinity, and for

    connecting Affinity to the rest of your tech and data stack.


    Please note that this new version of the API is not at feature parity with

    [Affinity API v1](https://api-docs.affinity.co/). We will add to this new
    version to cover more of

    v1's functionality over time. **This API version is also only available on
    select Affinity license

    types.** See

    [this Help Center
    article](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/5563700459533-Getting-started-with-the-Affinity-API-FAQs)

    or contact your Customer Success Manager for more information.


    # Getting Started


    All Affinity API endpoints use the base URL `https://api.affinity.co`. All
    v2 endpoint paths start

    with `/v2`. Requests must be sent over HTTPS.


    ## Using These Docs


    The first few sections of these docs cover general information on the API.
    Each subsequent section

    covers a set of API endpoints.


    Each endpoint is documented with its accepted request parameters, expected
    response shapes, and a

    sample request and response. Please note that the shape of a given response
    can vary depending on

    what "type" of object or data is being returned. When this is the case, the
    response documentation

    will include a dropdown that can be used to select the "type" for which to
    display the response

    shape.


    ## Authentication


    Affinity API v2 uses API keys and **bearer authentication** (this is an
    important difference from

    Affinity API v1's use of basic authentication).


    To generate an API key, navigate to the Settings page in the Affinity web
    app. You will need the

    "Generate an API key" role-based permission controlled by your Affinity
    admin to be able to do this.

    See

    [this Help Center
    article](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/360032633992-How-to-obtain-your-API-Key)

    for full instructions on API key generation, and

    [this
    article](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/360015976732-Account-Level-Permissions)

    for more information on role-based permissions in Affinity.


    Currently, we support one API key per user in your Affinity account. Your
    API key is able to read

    data and perform actions in Affinity on your behalf, so keep it safe as you
    would a password.


    Provide your API key as your bearer authentication token to start making
    calls to Affinity API v2.


    ## Permissions


    ### Overall requirements


    You must have the "Generate an API key" permission to be able to work with
    the Affinity API. Most

    users in most Affinity accounts with API access have this by default —
    Contact your Affinity admin

    if you are not able to generate an API key, and see

    [this
    article](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/360015976732-Account-Level-Permissions)

    for more information on role-based permissions in Affinity.


    ### Resource-level permissions


    The Affinity API respects sharing permissions that are set in-product. For
    example, if a given user

    does not have access to a list, note, or interaction in-product, they will
    not be able to see or

    modify it via API.


    ### Endpoint-level permissions


    Many API endpoints also require endpoint-specific permissions that map to
    permissions in-product.

    These permissions, along with the "Generate an API key" permission, are
    managed by your Affinity

    admin in the Settings page:


    | API v2 Endpoint                                            | Required
    Permission                  |

    | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
    ------------------------------------ |

    | GET `/v2/companies`                                        | "Export All
    Organizations directory" |

    | GET `/v2/companies/{id}`                                   | "Export All
    Organizations directory" |

    | GET `/v2/companies/{id}/list-entries`                      | "Export data
    from Lists"             |

    | GET `/v2/persons`                                          | "Export All
    People directory"        |

    | GET `/v2/persons/{id}`                                     | "Export All
    People directory"        |

    | GET `/v2/persons/{id}/list-entries`                        | "Export data
    from Lists"             |

    | GET `/v2/opportunities`                                    | "Export data
    from Lists"             |

    | GET `/v2/opportunities/{id}`                               | "Export data
    from Lists"             |

    | GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/list-entries`                      | "Export data
    from Lists"             |

    | GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/saved-views/{viewId}/list-entries` | "Export data
    from Lists"             |


    ## Rate Limits


    The Affinity API sets a limit on the number of calls that a user can make
    per minute, and that all

    the users on an account can make per month. It also sets a reasonable limit
    on the number of

    concurrent requests it will support from an account at one time.


    Requests to **both** Affinity API versions will count toward the one pool of
    requests allowed for a

    user or account. Once a per-minute, monthly, or concurrent rate limit is
    hit, subsequent requests

    will return an error code of 429. **We highly recommend designing your
    application to handle 429

    errors.**


    ### Per-Minute Limits (User-Level)


    To help protect our systems, API requests will be halted at **900 per user,
    per minute.** We may

    also lower this limit on a temporary basis to manage API availability.


    ### Concurrent Request Limits (Account-Level)


    To protect our systems and manage availability across customers, we set a
    reasonable limit on

    concurrent requests at the account level. Customers should not expect to hit
    this limit unless they

    are hitting the API with heavy operations from many concurrent threads at
    once.


    ### Monthly Plan Tier Limits (Account-Level)


    The overall number of requests you can make per month will depend on your
    account's plan tier.

    **This monthly account-level limit resets at the end of each calendar
    month.** Current rate limits

    by plan tier are:


    | Plan Tier  | Calls Per Month |

    | ---------- | --------------- |

    | Essentials | None            |

    | Scale      | 100k            |

    | Advanced   | 100k            |

    | Enterprise | Unlimited\*     |


    \*Per-Minute and Concurrent Request Limits still apply.


    ### Rate Limit Headers


    All API calls will return the following response headers with information
    about per-minute and

    monthly limits:


    | Header                           |
    Description                                             |

    | -------------------------------- |
    ------------------------------------------------------- |

    | X-Ratelimit-Limit-User           | Number of requests allowed per minute
    for the user      |

    | X-Ratelimit-Limit-User-Remaining | Number of requests remaining for the
    user               |

    | X-Ratelimit-Limit-User-Reset     | Time in seconds before the limit resets
    for the user    |

    | X-Ratelimit-Limit-Org            | Number of requests allowed per month
    for the account    |

    | X-Ratelimit-Limit-Org-Remaining  | Number of requests remaining for the
    account            |

    | X-Ratelimit-Limit-Org-Reset      | Time in seconds before the limit resets
    for the account |


    ## Pagination


    When an endpoint is expected to return multiple results, we break the
    results up into pages to make

    them easier to handle. To cycle forward through multiple pages of data, look
    for the `nextUrl`

    property in the `pagination` portion of an API response, and use it for your
    next request. See

    endpoint documentation for more information.


    ## Error Codes


    Here is a list of the error codes this API will generally return if
    something goes wrong (see

    endpoint documentation for endpoint-specific error information):


    | Error Code |
    Meaning

    # Data Model


    ## The Basics


    - The three top-level objects in Affinity are **Persons, Companies, and
    Opportunities**. (Please
      note: Companies are called Organizations in the Affinity web app.) These have profiles in the
      Affinity web app and can be added to Lists.
    - A lot of the work of Affinity happens within Lists. A **List** is a
    spreadsheet-like collection of
      rows tied to Persons, Companies, or Opportunities.
    - Each row on a List is a **List Entry**. A List Entry contains data and
    metadata about a given
      Person, Company, or Opportunity in the context of a List. This includes list-specific field data,
      and information about who added the row to the List and when.
      - Do note that a given entity can be added to a List more than once, i.e., it can have multiple
        List Entries on the same List. These List Entries can have different list-specific field data
        and List Entry-level metadata.
    - Each column on a List maps to a **Field**. Fields and field data also show
    up within Affinity
      profile pages, extensions, and integrations.
      - Some Fields are scoped to a single List — These are **list-specific fields**, and in the API,
        their data can only be accessed through the List Entry resource. "Global" data from other Fields
        can be accessed both through the Person/Company/Opportunity resource and the List Entry
        resource.

    ## Working with Field Data


    ### Field Types and IDs


    There are a few types of Fields in Affinity, differentiated by the scope and
    source of their data:


    | Field&nbsp;Type             |
    Description                                                                                                                                                 
    | Example
    Fields                                                                                                                                             
    | Field ID
    Pattern                                                                                                                            
    |

    | --------------------------- |
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |

    | `enriched`                  | Firmographic, funding, and people Fields
    populated by Affinity. These can be "Affinity Data" Fields or come from
    distinct data partners.                     | "Affinity Data: Description",
    "Dealroom: Number of
    Employees"                                                                                              
    | A string representing the enrichment source, followed by the field name,
    e.g. `affinity-data-description` or `dealroom-number-of-employees`. |

    | `list`                      | Fields that are specific to the context of a
    given list. These can only be accessed through `*/list-entries` endpoints in
    this version of the API.           | Default "Status" and "Amount" columns,
    custom columns that pertain to a given List of deals or
    founders                                                     | `field-`,
    followed by a unique integer, e.g.
    `field-1234`                                                                                   
    |

    | `global`                    | Fields that persist across an Affinity
    account and are not
    list-specific.                                                                                   
    | "My Firm's Founder Scoring
    Column"                                                                                                                         
    | `field-`, followed by a unique integer, e.g.
    `field-1234`                                                                                   
    |

    | `relationship-intelligence` | Fields populated by Affinity from users'
    email and calendar data that provide insight into your firm's relationship
    with a given Person/Company/Opportunity. | "Source of Introduction", "First
    Email", "Last Email", "First Event", "Last Event", "Next Event", "First Chat
    Message", "Last Chat Message", "Last Contact" | A string similar to the
    field's name in-product, e.g.
    `source-of-introduction`                                                              
    |


    ### Field Value Types


    Field data can take a variety of shapes. These value types are described in
    the Affinity Help Center

    [here](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/115001608232-How-to-create-a-new-column-in-a-list).

    Here is a list of the same value types, as represented in this API. Notice
    how array types end with

    `-multi`:


    | Single Type         | Array Type                |

    | ------------------- | ------------------------- |

    | `text`              | Not supported in Affinity |

    | `number`            | `number-multi`            |

    | `datetime`          | Not supported in Affinity |

    | `location`          | `location-multi`          |

    | `dropdown`          | `dropdown-multi`          |

    | `ranked-dropdown`   | Not supported in Affinity |

    | `person`            | `person-multi`            |

    | `company`           | `company-multi`           |

    | `filterable-text`\* | `filterable-text-multi`\* |


    \*Please note that `filterable-text` and `filterable-text-multi` are special
    types that operate

    similarly to `dropdown` and `dropdown-multi`. They are reserved for
    Affinity-populated Fields, and

    users cannot create Fields with these types.


    When an array-typed value has no data in it, the API will return `null`
    (rather than an empty

    array).


    ### Retrieving Field Data


    To retrieve field data on companies, persons, or opportunities, call GET
    `/v2/companies`, GET

    `/v2/persons`, or one of our GET `*/list-entries` endpoints. (Note that
    Opportunities only have

    list-specific Fields, so all their field data will live on the
    `*/list-entries` endpoints.) For most

    of these endpoints, you will need to specify the Fields for which you want
    data returned via the

    `fieldIds` or `fieldTypes` parameter — Otherwise, entities will be returned
    without any field data

    attached.


    The GET `/v2/companies` and `/v2/persons` endpoints can return entities with
    enriched, global, and

    relationship intelligence field data attached, but do not support
    list-specific field data. **To get

    comprehensive field data including list-specific field data on Companies and
    Persons, use the GET

    `*/list-entries` endpoints.**


    ### Specifying Desired Fields (Field Selection)


    As mentioned above, you will need to specify the Fields (either by ID or by
    Type) for which you want

    data returned when using the following endpoints:


    - GET `/v2/companies`

    - GET `/v2/companies/{id}`

    - GET `/v2/persons`

    - GET `/v2/persons/{id}`

    - GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/list-entries`


    Each of these endpoints has a `fieldIds` parameter that accepts an array of
    Field IDs, and a

    `fieldTypes` parameter that accepts an array of Field Types. Use the GET
    `*/fields` endpoints to get

    Field IDs, Field Types, and other Field-level metadata:


    - Call GET `/v2/companies/fields` and `/v2/persons/fields` to get a list of
    the enriched, global,
      and relationship intelligence (AKA non-list-specific) Fields that exist on Companies and Persons,
      respectively. These are the Fields whose values are available to pull via GET `/v2/companies`, GET
      `/v2/companies/{id}`, GET `/v2/persons`, and `/v2/persons/{id}`.

    - Call GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/fields` to get a list of the enriched,
    global, relationship
      intelligence, **and list-specific** Fields for a given List. These are the Fields whose values are
      available to pull via GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/list-entries`.

    The following endpoints don't require field selection:


    - GET `/v2/lists/{listId}/saved-views/{viewId}/list-entries` — See below.
    This endpoint returns just
      the field data that has been pulled into the given Saved View via UI.
    - GET `/v2/companies/{id}/list-entries` and GET
    `/v2/persons/{id}/list-entries` — These endpoints
      return comprehensive field data for the given person or company in the context of each List Entry.

    ### Saved Views


    A Saved View allows a user to configure the Fields they want to see in the
    UI for a given List, and

    set filters and sorts on the rows on that List. A List can have multiple
    Saved Views. In the context

    of this API, Saved Views can be useful for specifying the exact Fields for
    which data is needed. The

    `*/saved-views/{viewId}/list-entries` endpoint also respects the filters
    that have been set on the

    given Saved View in the Affinity web app. (It does not, however, respect
    sorts just yet.)


    ### Partner Data Restrictions


    This API supports pulling data from

    [Affinity
    Data](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/360058255052-Affinity-Data)
    fields and

    select

    [Dealroom
    fields](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/6106558518797-Dealroom-co-data-in-Affinity#h_01G2N22SVH7TJR3DJV3NQDE9HQ).

    Due the agreements we have with some of our data partners, the API does not
    expose data from the

    following sources:


    - Crunchbase, including Crunchbase UUID

    - Pitchbook

    - [Dealroom "exclusive"
    fields](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/6106558518797-Dealroom-co-data-in-Affinity#h_01G2N22YEAZJ5TC1X9ENKZFWF5)


    ## A Note on Nested Associations


    Some GET endpoints return "association" data under `fields`. For example,
    the Persons GET endpoints

    return data about which Companies a Person is associated with in Affinity.
    The Opportunities GET

    endpoints return similar data about associated Companies and Persons. The
    List Entries GET endpoints

    also return this data for Person and Opportunity List Entries.


    The API truncates these nested arrays of Persons or Companies **at 100
    entries**. For example, if an

    Opportunity is associated with 200 Persons in Affinity, only 100 of those
    Persons will be returned

    by the GET `/opportunities` or `/opportunities/{id}` endpoint.

    # Changelog


    ## March 25, 2024


    - Added the ability to retrieve the date and other details of your firm's
    "First Email", "Last
      Email", "First Event", "Last Event", "Next Event", "First Chat Message", "Last Chat Message", and
      "Last Contact" with a given entity. Use these timestamps to add relationship context to your
      applications, and to identify founders and companies that need investors' attention.
    - Endpoints that previously required a `fieldIds` parameter to return field
    data, now accept either
      `fieldIds` or `fieldTypes`, and will return field data accordingly. See the
      [Specifying Desired Fields (Field Selection)](https://developer.affinity.co/) section
      of these docs for more information. The new `fieldTypes` parameter should make field data
      retrieval easier for users looking to pull data from many similar Fields at a time.

    ## January 4, 2023


    - Most endpoints that return field data now require the user to use the
    `fieldIds` parameter to
      specify which Fields they want data for. Without `fieldIds` specified, these endpoints will return
      basic entity data but not field data.

    ## December 12, 2023


    - Added the ability to retrieve metadata (e.g. ID, name, type, enrichment
    source, and data type) on
      Fields. See the [Retrieving Field Metadata](https://developer.affinity.co/) section
      of these docs for more information.

        Returns basic information and non-list-specific field data on each
        Company.


        To retrieve field data, you must use either the `fieldIds` or the
        `fieldTypes` parameter

        to specify the Fields for which you want data returned.

        These Field IDs and Types can be found using the GET
        `/v2/companies/fields` endpoint.

        When no `fieldIds` or `fieldTypes` are provided, Companies will be
        returned without any field data attached.

        To supply multiple `fieldIds` or `fieldTypes` parameters, generate a
        query string that looks like this:

        `?fieldIds=field-1234&fieldIds=affinity-data-location` or
        `?fieldTypes=enriched&fieldTypes=global`.

        Paginate through the List Entries (AKA rows) on a given List.

        Returns basic information and field data, including list-specific

        field data, on each Company, Person, or Opportunity on the List.

        List Entries also include metadata about their creation,

        i.e., when they were added to the List and by whom.


        To retrieve field data, you must use either the `fieldIds` or the
        `fieldTypes` parameter

        to specify the Fields for which you want data returned.

        These Field IDs and Types can be found using the GET
        `/v2/lists/{listId}/fields` endpoint.

        When no `fieldIds` or `fieldTypes` are provided, List Entries will be
        returned without any field data attached.

        To supply multiple `fieldIds` or `fieldTypes` parameters, generate a
        query string that looks like this:

        `?fieldIds=field-1234&fieldIds=affinity-data-location` or
        `?fieldTypes=enriched&fieldTypes=global`.

        Use this endpoint when you need to filter entities or only want **some**

        field data to be returned: This endpoint respects the filters set on a
        Saved View

        via web app, and only returns field data corresponding to the columns
        that have been

        pulled into the Saved View via web app.


        Though this endpoint respects the Saved View's filters and column/Field
        selection,

        it does not yet preserve sort order. This endpoint also only supports
        **sheet-type

        Saved Views**, and not board- or dashboard-type Saved Views.


        See the [Data Model](https://developer.affinity.co/) section for more
        information about Saved Views.
