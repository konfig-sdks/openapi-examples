    # Introducing the Gladly API


    At Gladly, we believe that customer service is best when it's a
    conversation.

    That means more than just helping customers with one-off questions or
    issues: it's about making them feel known, valued, and respected for the
    individuals they are.


    The Gladly API was built to help facilitate those relationships, providing
    agents with the rich customer context

    they need to deliver seamless experiences that make customers feel like
    they're more than just a number in a sea of others.


    # Overview


    You can integrate easily with Gladly by calling Gladly's [REST
    API](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/)

    and implementing the [Lookup API](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/) to
    provide data from your own services.


    Some examples of what you do through Gladly APIs include managing customer
    profile data, interacting with a customer's timeline,

    providing the latest information about a customer's orders, and more.


    ## REST API


    Clients can access the **REST API** via HTTPS at your organization's Gladly
    domain (e.g. `https://{organization}.gladly.com`).


    Resources follow REST semantics and utilize industry-standard HTTP verbs,
    response codes, and authentication schemes.

    In addition, all responses and payloads are in JSON with consistent error
    codes and formats.


    ## Lookup API


    The Gladly **Lookup API** allows your organization to provide data services
    to power the agent's experience with a complete view of your customers'

    information, transactions, and activity. You can provide a web service that
    implements the Lookup API and Gladly will call it when that data is needed.


    Like the REST API, the Lookup API is specified using REST semantics, and
    exchanges JSON requests and responses authenticated and signed with secure
    keys.


    Gladly will perform lookups when certain activities occur within Gladly,
    such as when a customer's profile is loaded.


    A detailed overview of Lookup Adaptor architecture, requests, resposnes and
    more can be found
    [here](https://help.gladly.com/developer/docs/lookup-adapter-introduction).


    ## Testing


    Test the myriad possibilities of the Gladly API in a safe, secure space.
    We'll enable the Gladly API in a separate sandbox environment, so you can
    experiment freely without impacting your production environment (or vice
    versa).


    Your sandbox environment is accessible at
    `https://{organization}.gladly.qa`, where `organization` is your company
    name. For specific API endpoints, see documentation below.


    # Getting Started


    Think of this section as getting the keys to unlocking your access to the
    Gladly APIs.

    First, you'll need to set up an account with the necessary API
    [permissions](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/).

    With these permissions, you can then go on to create the [API
    Token(s)](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/) you need to access Gladly's
    API [resources](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/).


    ## Permissions


    Gladly Administrators can set API permissions on an agent-by-agent basis.

    We'll discuss how this maps to API access in the section on
    [authentication](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/) below.


    To allow a user to create API tokens and access the API:

    1. Log in to your Gladly instance.

    2. Open the menu on the top left-hand corner of the page.

    3. Navigate to **Settings** > **Users*

    4. Search and click the user profile you wish to give access to.

    5. You'll see a permission called **API User**. Select it, while making sure
    to keep the user's **Agent** role intact.

    6. Hit **Save** to give access.


    ![Agent profile screen](assets/permissions-agent.png)


    We recommend creating a dedicated user to make API calls, whose account
    won't be used for agent and organization management.

    This will help you with any future audits of API activity vs. agent
    activity.


    ## Creating API Tokens


    You must create an API token to access Gladly API resources (see above
    [Permissions](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/)).

    If your profile already has access to the **API User** permission, you'll
    see a menu item titled **More settings**. Click **More settings**:


    ![API Token Menu](assets/permissions-token-nav.png)


    Click **API Tokens**, then the **Create Token** button on the upper
    right-hand corner of the page:


    ![API Token Add](assets/permissions-token-add.png)


    A token will be generated and named, by default, **New Token** (though
    depending on whether you have existing tokens, it may be named New Token 2,
    or New Token 3, etc.).

    You can rename the token to something more easily referenceable by clicking
    the name to edit.


    This token will be associated with your agent profile, which we refer to as
    the API User in this document.


    ![API Token View](assets/permissions-token-view.png)


    For security purposes, you'll only see a new token once before you navigate
    away from the page.


    ## Replacing/Rotating API Tokens


    Should you lose this token, or wish to rotate your application keys, you can
    do the following:


    1. Generate a new token.

    2. Store the new token in a secure location.

    3. Delete the old token.

    4. Update your applications/scripts with the new token.

      ## Conversation


      A **Conversation** in Gladly contains the timeline of activity for a
      customer including communications to and from your organization along with
      other internal and external activity.

      Conversations API enables you to interact with the customer conversation
      timeline.


      ## Conversation Items


      A number of different types of items may appear in a customer's timeline.

      ### Chat Message


      Content of messages sent between Gladly and customers through Gladly Chat.


      ### Conversation Status Change


      Record of a change in the status of a conversation.


      ### Customer Activity


      Information about activities customers participated in, for example,
      emails they received, issues in another system, or customer satisfaction
      surveys they answered.

      These can be created through the API to bring in information from other
      systems.

      Adding an activity to the customer timeline is not customer facing.

      For example, posting an email activity to the timeline does not send an
      email to the customer.

      A task is a way to create and do internal follow-up work for a customer
      within Gladly. Tasks have a due date, an assignee, a description of what
      is needed for a customer, and can be commented on. These can be created
      through the API to assign items to work within Gladly.

      The collection of Message Automation APIs are used to facilitate
      communication between a Customer via a Gladly channel and a 3rd party
      Automation service, such as a chat bot. These APIs allow an Automation
      service to interact with a Customer as well as close a Conversation with a
      Customer or route a Customer to an Agent. Subscribe to the [Webhook
      Event](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/) `AUTOMATION/MESSAGE_RECEIVED`
      to receive inbound messages. **Note** The Message Automation APIs are
      currently in a private beta and attachments are currently not supported.
      Please contact your Customer Success Manager for access.
    name: Message Automation
  - description: >
      Export API is a simple, comprehensive, file-based data export. You can
      export the lifetime of your customers' conversations in Gladly to a
      central data repository such as your data warehouse or data lake. You can
      export all communications successfully delivered within a specified date
      range.  The export date range could be the past hour, the past 24 hours,
      or a custom data range. Please note, for one-time exports covering a
      period greater than six months, a service fee may apply.


      Job results can be deleted once downloaded.  Delete will remove all result
      files along with the job metadata.  Files older than 14 days are removed
      from Gladly and jobs older than 14 days are not available from the API. 
      If you discover that you need the deleted files later, please contact
      Gladly Support to regenerate them for you.


      ### SCHEDULING EXPORT JOBS


      You can schedule a one-time or repeating - hourly or daily - data export
      job.  By default, each organization has a daily export job configured.  To
      schedule a one-time job or change the job frequency, please contact Gladly
      Support.

      An **Agent** represents the user profile of a person who helps customers
      in Gladly.

      The API allows you to lookup Agents who participated in conversations with
      customers.
    name: Agents
  - description: >
      A **Public Answer** in Gladly represents a consumer-facing Answer.


      Answers API allows you to search and retrieve Public Answers (created

      directly in the Gladly UI), which you can display in the Glad App

      web widget, use to build your website's help center/FAQ page, or publish

      on any page on your website.


      This API can be used without an API token because it only provides access
      to

      public content. You may also work with Gladly Support to

      enable [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

      access so the API can be used directly from client-side javascript.

      A **Customer** in Gladly represents information about a customer of your
      organization including their profile, contact information,

      notes, and transactions.


      Customers API allows you to add, update, and get customer profile data.


      ### Error Handling

      Id, mobile phone number, and email address must be unique across customer
      records. 409 errors returned will

      include details on any conflicts, such as a field being taken.


      Additionally, errors may be returned due to customer profiles being
      merged. If a customer has been merged into

      another, requests to get a customer by id will return 301 errors
      specifying the new id of the customer,

      and requests to update a customer by id will return 404 errors.

      A **Topic** is a way of labeling a conversation in Gladly for specific
      business purposes. For example, an agent may apply the topic "Return" to a
      conversation where a customer returns merchandise.

      Topics are used for reporting and to control various workflows.


      Topics can be configured to have a nested hierarchy. For instance, the
      topic "Return" could be a parent of "Size" and "Color" child topics. Visit
      our [Help
      Pages](https://help.gladly.com/docs/principles-of-hierarchical-topics) to
      learn more about Hierarchical Topics.

      Freeform Topics allow you to associate granular data like Order Number to
      a Conversation. This data can be accessed for analysis via APIs, Webhooks,
      and AWS EventBridge. They are powered by custom attributes as you will see
      throughout this API, the Conversations API, the Events API and events used
      in Webhooks. 


      Note: These attributes are currently associated to the Conversation entity
      only and are therefore different from customAttributes listed under the
      Customer entity. See the Customer API for more information on Customer
      custom attributes.

      Gladly **webhooks** are an easy way to send notifications about Gladly
      events and have them delivered to the endpoint of your choice, giving you
      a streamlined method to trigger associated actions in external systems
      that respond to events in Gladly.


      Simply choose where to send notifications about events that you are
      interested in (e.g. when a conversation is closed), and they’ll be
      delivered to the endpoint of your choice.


      Configure webhooks using the [Webhooks
      API](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/) or the Webhooks Admin Page.


      Users with API User permissions can configure webhooks by navigating to
      Integrations > Webhooks.


      ![Webhooks admin page](assets/webhooks-admin.png)


      ## Securing Webhooks

      We provide two methods for your web service to authenticate requests from
      Gladly.

      We recommend implementing at least one **authentication** option.


      ### Basic Authentication


      For this method you will supply a username and password with the webhooks
      `credentials` field. This will be sent with each request. You may
      optionally supply a realm if needed.


      ### Header Based Token Authentication


      For this method you will configure one or more HTTP headers with the
      webhook's `headers` field. Gladly will send in each request to your web
      service.


      ## Ping Event

      Whenever you enable a webhook or update a webhook's URL, we'll send you a
      special `PING` event.


      Your web service is expected to respond with a 200 status code to this
      event. If it does not respond or times out, the webhook create or update
      will not succeed.


      ## Retry Policy


      **Effective 6/28/23**


      If your service responds to an event with a response code outside the 2XX
      range or times out after 15 seconds, Gladly considers that delivery as
      failed and will resend the request up to 4 times over an hour. After the
      fourth attempt, we will deactivate the webhook and wil notify all API
      Users in your organization's environment via email. 


      To reactivate the webhook, your team will first need to investigate the
      issue and make the necessary changes for the webhook to start working
      again. Once the issue is resolved, you will be able to re-activate the
      webhook via the Settings > Webhooks page.


      The following table shows the intervals between each retry attempt.


      | Attempt | Retry interval           |

      | ------- | ------------------------ |

      | 1       | 30 seconds               |

      | 2       | 5 minutes                |

      | 3       | 30 minutes               |

      | 4       | 1 hour                   |


      ## Logs

      We provide the last 100 HTTP request logs for a webhook that occurred
      during the past month. Logs can take up to 30 seconds to view and require
      you to refresh the page.


      ![Webhook Logs](assets/webhook-log.png)


      Each log displays the status, event type and occurred at timestamp for a
      given request. You can expand the log for more details about the request
      and response.

      For more information about webhook logs, please see our [Help
      Documentation](https://connect.gladly.com/docs/help-documentation/article/reactivate-deactivated-webhooks/?highlight=webhook).


      ## Payloads

      Gladly payloads are intentionally small: they contain only Gladly IDs and
      event names rather than the object/data that has been modified or created


      This helps Gladly webhooks perform more quickly when many events occur
      throughout the day. This also assists with security, so if you
      misconfigure a webhook, it does not send sensitive information to an
      outside service.


      To retrieve more information about the object in question, you may make an
      additional Gladly API call to retrieve the Gladly object. For example, to
      know more about conversationId whose status was updated, call the [GET
      Conversation API](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/) or the [List Items
      in Conversation API](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/).


      ## Available Events

      Please see the [Help
      Documentation](https://help.gladly.com/docs/reporting-concepts) for more
      information about many of the events listed below.

      **Customer Lookup** allows you to provide a web service to search and get
      customer profile data and transactions.


      To support Customer Lookup, your organization will deploy an adaptor
      service (aka Lookup Adaptor) running on your network that implements the
      Lookup API.


      From there you can can connect the service to internal systems providing
      customer and transaction data.


      ![Lookup Architecture](assets/lookup-adapter-arch.svg)


      ### Overview


      Building a Lookup Adaptor will allow you to showcase extended customer
      profile information and actions in Gladly. For example, you may extend the
      customer profile in Gladly with loyalty points and lifetime value to
      assist with VIP routing. You can also display historical orders in Gladly
      to allow agents to view frequently used directly in Gladly without having
      to go to another system. You can even extend Gladly with Actions so that
      agents can cancel orders or award loyalty points directly in Gladly!


      On a high-level, Gladly will perform a request to your Customer Lookup
      integration(s) to retrieve extended information from your system(s) about
      a Customer Profile in Gladly.


      To ensure performance, Gladly recommends that your Customer Lookup
      integration(s) be able to respond back to the Gladly POST request in < 5
      seconds. Gladly will terminate the request in 15 seconds if it receives no
      response from your integration(s). Please note that if one Customer Lookup
      integration times out / responds with an error that Gladly will consider
      this an error for all Customer Lookup integration(s).


      ### Sample code


      Sample code for building a Customer Lookup integration can be found
      [here](https://github.com/gladly/lookup-practice).


      ### Architecture, Setup, Authentication, Sample Requests and More


      A detailed overview of Lookup Adaptor architecture, requests, resposnes
      and more can be found
      [here](https://help.gladly.com/developer/docs/lookup-adapter-introduction).
    name: Customer Lookup
  - description: >
      As we evolve the Gladly API over time, changes will be either added to the
      current version of the API (i.e. **[backwards compatible
      changes](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/)**),

      or result in a new version that you will need to integrate with afresh
      (i.e. **[non-backwards compatible
      changes](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/)**).


      ## URL Path Versioning


      The various versions of the Gladly API will be differentiated via global
      versioning, with the relevant version number reflected within the path
      parameter of the URL:

          https://organization.gladly.com/api/v{major-version-number}/{resource path}

      ## Backwards Compatible Changes


      For the most part, changes to the API will be backwards compatible, such
      as adding resources, additional fields to response objects,

      new value types for enums, or expanding a validation constraint to be more
      accepting.


      Ensure your client can gracefully handle or ignore unfamiliar fields and
      values so it continues to operate smoothly over the lifespan of an API
      version.


      ## Non-Backwards Compatible Changes


      Versions will be upleveled when a non-backwards compatible change occurs.
      This should not happen often, but can occur in the case of:

      - a field being removed from an object

      - a resource path no longer being supported

      - changing the type of a field

      - adding a new required parameter for a resource

      - constricting the validation parameters for a request


      These will only occur when absolutely necessary and a summary of the
      changes from version to version can be viewed in the release notes.

      Previous versions will be supported for a period of time before being
      removed after providing ample advanced notice.
    name: Versioning
  - description: >
      Wherever possible, Gladly uses standard HTTP status codes to signal the
      success or failure of a call.

      Generally speaking, `2xx` statuses indicate success, `3xx` statuses
      indicate the client must take further action such as redirection,

      `4xx` statuses indicate an error with the input supplied by the client,
      `5xx` statuses indicate an unexpected error from Gladly servers (these
      will be rare cases).


      ## Common Status Codes


      | HTTP Status | Description |

      | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

      | 200         | Success with results in response body             |

      | 201         | Resource created                                  |

      | 204         | Success with empty response body                  |

      | 301         | The resource location has moved                   |

      | 400         | API usage error                                   |

      | 401         | Authentication not provided                       |

      | 403         | User does not have persmission to access resource |

      | 404         | Resource is not found                             |

      | 429         | Rate limit reached                                |


      ## Programmatic Remediation

      In the case of a `400` response, there will be a structured list of
      `error` objects that will provide information to correct the error.

      The error object will contain a `code` to describe the problem.


      The most common codes are:


      | Code         | Description                            |

      | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |

      | blank        | Presence error                         |

      | invalid      | Format error                           |

      | moved        | This resource is now located elsewhere |

      | not_a_number | Value not numeric error                |

      | present      | Absence error                          |

      | taken        | Uniqueness error                       |

      | too_long     | Exceeds permissible length error       |

      | wrong_length | Length is not equal to expected error  |


      Refer to the errors section of each endpoint for more information.


      Example:

          {"errors":[{"code":"blank","detail":"one of emailAddress, phoneNumber must be present"}]}

  - description: "The number of requests for an **[organization](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/)** is rate limited for all APIs to ensure that adequate resources are available for all customers.\n\nGladly has two types of API rate limits:\n\n### Request Limit\nRequest limits are applied on a per-second basis and are implemented to protect against denial-of-service attacks. This ensures that adequate resources are available for all customers.\n\n### Concurrency Limit\nConcurrency limits are applied on the number of simultaneous requests to the endpoint. For example, a few long-lasting requests to an API endpoint simultaneously might exceed the concurrent rate limit for that endpoint.\n\n## Default Rate Limit\n\nOrganizations that send many requests in quick succession may see error responses that show up as status code\_**`429`**.\n>Individual APIs may have their own API Rate Limit and will be documented as such. Otherwise, the following default rate limits apply.\n\n| Method              | Request Limit                     | Concurrency Limit           |\n| ------------------- | -----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| GET                 | 10 Requests per second             | Not Applicable                   |\n| POST                | 10 Requests per second             | Not Applicable                   |\n| PUT                 | 10 Requests per second             | Not Applicable                   |\n| PATCH               | 10 Requests per second             | Not Applicable                   |\n| DELETE              | 10 Requests per second             | Not Applicable                   |\n\nWe may adjust limits to prevent abuse.\n\nIf you have questions about rate limited requests, please contact [Gladly Support](https://help.gladly.com/docs/contact-gladly-support).\n\n## Reporting API Rate Limit\n\nThe [Reports](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/) APIs have slightly different default rate limits than other APIs.\n\n| Method              | Request Limit                     | Concurrency Limit           |\n| ------------------- | -----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| POST                | 10 Requests per minute             | 2 concurrent requests at a time across the entire organization                   |\n\n## Handling Rate Limit\n\nThe Gladly API response headers include the organization's current rate limit and the number of requests remaining in the current second.\nThe remaining limit is calculated using the total number of requests received from all clients with your organization's API tokens.\n\n```json\n  Ratelimit-Limit-Second\n  Ratelimit-Remaining-Second\n```\n\nYou can anticipate hitting the rate limit by checking these headers.\n\nOne technique for gracefully handling rate-limited requests is to watch for\_**`429`**\_status codes and implement a client-side retry mechanism with an exponential backoff schedule.\nWe’d also recommend building some randomness into the backoff schedule to avoid a\_**[thundering herd effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem)**.\n"

        Custom Channels allows for building custom channel integration with
        Gladly. This functionality is deactivated 

        by default. 


        **Note that the intended use case for custom channels is any non Gladly
        messaging based supported channel.**


        Please contact [Gladly Support](https://gladly.com/support) if you would
        like to activate this API and believe you have a valid use case.


        To receive a Custom Channel message, you must first create a Custom
        Channel and a Custom Channel Entry Point in Gladly Settings -> Custom
        Channels page. This API will accept messages from the channel
        integration and process them similarly to built-in messaging channels.

                      At Gladly we set out to reinvent customer service. Why?
                      Because 21st century consumers are different. They are
                      from 18 to 80 years old, expect the brands they love to
                      recognize them, and to be able to communicate with your
                      agents over all channels – all the time.

        You may supply only the properties which you want to update or insert
        into the profile.

        When updating arrays, such as `phones` and `emails` you must provide the
        entire list of values

        since it is not possible to add or delete a single value.


        If a customer has been merged into another, an error will be returned
        specifying the new id of the customer.

        List all schedules. Currently, only one schedule can be configured per
        organization. The schedule will generate recurring data export jobs with
        an hourly or daily frequency. By default, each organization has a daily
        export job configured. To change the job frequency, please contact
        Gladly Support.


        Hourly schedules generate new jobs on a roughly two hour lag after the
        `nextStartAt` time. For example, for an hourly schedule with a
        `nextStartAt` equal to `2019-01-21T08:00:00.00Z`, the next job will be
        created at approximately `2019-01-21T10:00:00.00Z`. Daily schedules will
        run jobs during the night (UTC time).

        Files are returned in `.jsonl` format where each line is a `json` object
        representing an element from the array of data. Please note that, in
        rare cases, conversation items with invalid attributes may be excluded
        from the data export. For example:

        - An email message that was undelivered due to an invalid recipient
        email address

        - EMAIL / SMS auto-replies sent by Gladly to the customer via a Rule

        - Reports
      summary: Generate a work session report
      operationId: Reports_generateWorkSessionReport
      description: >
        A **Work Session** represents a period of time that an Agent spends
        working with a Customer on a given channel, during a given Contact
        (messaging exchange, phone call, etc.). In particular:
          - A Customer may have 0 or more Conversations, but only 1 Conversation is open at any given time.
          - A Conversation may contain 0 or more Contacts (e.g.: A single phone call, a chat session, an email session).
          - A Contact may have 0 or more Work Sessions (i.e.: Agents who work on the Contact).
          - A Work Session is the unique combination of contact_session_id and agent_id. The agent_id column will be NULL if the contact has not been handled by any Agent.

        The Work Session Report API contains **both** contacts and work
        sessions. It allows you to understand what your inbound contact volume
        looks like, and to get a view into how Agents are using their time. The
        primary use of this information is for forecasting and scheduling
        purposes, but it can also be used to understand, at a fine-grained
        level, aspects of agent behavior, agent performance, multichannel
        conversation patterns and more.


        The time anchor for data returned by this API is
        COALESCE(contact_session_created_at, contact_session_ended_at) (i.e.: if
        contact_session_ended_at does not exist, use contact_session_created_at.
        Otherwise, use contact_session_ended_at).


        This means that if it is currently 2023-03-23T00:00Z and:
          - contact_session_id A was created on 2023-03-21T04:00Z and ended on 2023-03-22T04:00Z
          - You set the startAt time filter to 2023-03-21T00:00Z
          - You set the endAt time filter to 2023-03-22T00:00Z
          - You would not be able to retrieve contact_session_id A in your API request. Instead, you will need to set the endAt time filter to now() (aka 2023-03-23T00:00Z) to retrieve the contact information.

        Therefore, the general recommendation to get correct data is always to
        set the endAt time to now() rather than the end interval you'd like to
        analyze - this will accomodate contacts that "move" intervals due to
        ending.


        Note that:
          - work_session_unknown_time_sec and work_session_after_contact_time_sec may accumulate after the contact ends and before the conversation ends / another contact begins
          - work_session_handle_time_sec will only be available for a contact after it ends
