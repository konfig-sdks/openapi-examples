    ExpenseClaim:
      title: The ExpenseClaim Resource
      description: >-
        When a user wants to declare his expenses, he creates an `ExpenseClaim`.


        An `ExpenseClaim` is created by regrouping one or more
        `ExpenseTempItems` and converting them into ExpenseClaimItems.


        Once created, an `ExpenseClaim` has to be approved by his manager.


        Multiple `ExpenseClaims` can be created through a single request.
