      Enables you to perform a Change Job task. Using these REST APIs, you can
      get and update job change information such as location, administrative
      options, move team options, start details, contracts, business title, job
      profile, position, and job classification.


      To start and submit a job change request for a specific worker: 


      1. Initiate a job change request by calling the POST
      /workers/{ID}/jobChanges method, which returns the new job change ID. 


      2. Update data for the job change request by calling the PATCH
      /jobChanges/{id}/{subResource}/{subResourceID} endpoints. Specify the new
      job change ID as the {ID} and {subResourceID} path parameters. 


      3. Submit the job change request by calling the POST
      /jobChanges/{ID}/submit endpoint. The updated data in the preceding job
      change PATCH requests do not persist until you call POST
      /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.

        Initiates an organization assignment change for a specific worker.

        Call this method to start a new change organization assignment event,
        which returns a new change organization assignment ID. Use the new ID to
        reference the change organization assignment event in subsequent methods
        that update or get information about the same event.


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this POST method.  The
        updates in this POST method do not persist until you call POST
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify at least this required field: date, worker
        {id}, job {id}


        To retrieve a worker ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/workers prompt endpoint with
        the effectiveDate query parameter. It returns HREF links to workers by
        category. You can filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it
        returns workers on the current date. Only workers without blocking
        events or available for organization assignment change for the current
        user are returned.


        To retrieve a job ID, call the
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/jobs prompt endpoint with the
        worker query parameter.  It returns all positions for the worker with
        current user access to do an organization assignment change . You can
        filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns positions on
        the current date.

        Partially updates the start details for the specified job change ID. 

        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


        You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/startDetails/{subResourceID} to get
        the existing data to update. 


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify at least these request fields: date,
        reason{id}. 


        To retrieve a reason ID, call the GET /values/jobChangesGroup/reason
        prompt endpoint, which takes the job change ID as the staffingEvent
        query parameter. If you specify the staffingEvent parameter, it returns
        change job reasons for the staffingEvent, by the change job category. By
        default, it returns all change job categories and reasons.

        Partially updates the job profile options for the specified job change
        ID.


        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


        You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/jobProfile/{subResourceID} to get the
        existing data to update.


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify at least this required field:
        jobProfile{id}


        To retrieve a jobProfile ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/jobProfiles prompt endpoint, which takes the job
        change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
        staffingEvent parameter, it returns HREF links to the job profiles by
        the prompt category. If you don't specify the staffingEvent parameter,
        it returns all job profiles, regardless of their categories. You can
        also filter the job profiles by the effectiveDate query parameter. The
        default is the current date.

        To retrieve a location ID, you can call the GET

        change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. It returns HREF links to

        To retrieve a workShift ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/workShifts prompt endpoint with the location
        query parameter. It returns work shifts by location. If you don't
        specify the location parameter, it returns an empty result.


        To retrieve a workSpace ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/workSpaces prompt endpoint with the location
        query parameter. It returns HREF links to workspaces by configured
        prompt categories for the specified location. You can filter the results
        by effectiveDate. By default, it returns workspaces on the current date.

        You can call GET
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/customorganization/{subResourceID}
        to get the existing data to update. 


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the custom organization
        {id}


        To retrieve a custom organization ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/customs prompt endpoint,
        which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
        parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
        the custom organizations, as of the event's effective date. If you don't
        specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the active custom
        organizations based on the current date.

        Partially updates the business unit option for the specified change
        organization assignment ID.

        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


        You can call GET
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/businessUnit/{subResourceID} to get
        the existing data to update. 


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the business unit. 


        To retrieve a businessUnit ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/businessUnit prompt endpoint,
        which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
        parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
        the business units by organization, as of the event's effective date. If
        you don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the
        business units by active organization based on the current date.

        You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/startDetails/{subResourceID} to get

        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The

        In the request body, specify at least these request fields:
        position{id}, createPosition, closePosition, availableForOverlap


        To retrieve a position ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/proposedPosition prompt endpoint, which takes
        the job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. It returns HREF
        links to proposed positions based on staffing event for contingent
        workers. You can filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it
        returns all proposed positions on current date.

        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


        You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/administrative/{subResourceID} to get
        the existing data to update. 


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


        Note that there are no localization constraints in this API version. You
        can update the workingFTE and paidFTE fields even if the fields have not
        been localized.


        To retrieve a positionWorkerType ID, you can call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/employeeTypes prompt endpoint, with
        staffingEvent and location query parameters. If you specify the
        staffingEvent parameter, it returns HREF links to employee types by
        country. By default, it returns all employee types, excluding contingent
        workers.


        For the positionWorkerType ID, you can also call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/contingentWorkerTypes prompt endpoint, with
        staffingEvent and location query parameters. If you specify the
        staffingEvent parameter, it returns HREF links to contingent worker
        types for staffing event. If you specify location, it returns HREF links
        to contingent worker types by location or country. By default, it
        returns all contingent worker types.


        To retrieve a workersCompensationCodeOverride ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/workersCompensationCodeOverrides prompt
        endpoint, which takes the job change ID as the staffing Event query
        parameter. 


        To retrieve a payRateType ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/payRateTypes prompt endpoint, which takes the
        job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. It returns all pay
        rate types based on staffing event for contingent workers. By default,
        it returns all pay rate types in the tenant. 


        To retrieve companyInsiderType IDs, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/companyInsiderTypes prompt endpoint, which
        returns all company insider types in the tenant. 


        To retrieve an assignmentType ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/assignmentTypes prompt endpoint, which takes the
        job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
        staffingEvent parameter, it returns assignmentTypes for the
        staffingEvent. By default, it returns all active assignment types.


        To retrieve a workStudy ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/workStudyAwards prompt endpoint, which takes the
        job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
        staffingEvent parameter, it returns work study awards for the
        staffingEvent. By default, it returns all work studies in the tenant.


        To retrieve a timeType ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/timeTypes prompt endpoint, which takes the job
        change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
        staffingEvent parameter, it returns time types for the staffingEvent. By
        default, it returns all time types based on the Relax Hiring
        Restrictions tenant configuration.

        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


        You can call GET
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/company/{subResourceID} to get the
        existing data to update. 


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the company. 


        To retrieve a companies ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/companies prompt endpoint,
        which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
        parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
        the companies by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
        don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the
        companies by active organization based on the current date.

        Partially updates the costing organization options for the specified
        organization assignment change ID.
      operationId: OrganizationAssignmentChanges_partiallyUpdateCostingOptions
      description: >-
        Partially updates the costing organizations for the specified
        organization assignment change ID. Costing organizations include:
        Grants, Funds, Programs, and Gifts.

        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


        You can call GET
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/costing/{subResourceID} to get the
        existing data to update. 


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the grant, program, gift,
        or fund you want to update.


        To retrieve a grants ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/grants prompt endpoint, which
        takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
        parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
        the grants by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
        don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the grants
        by active organization based on the current date. 


        To retrieve a funds ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/funds prompt endpoint, which
        takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
        parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
        the funds by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
        don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the funds by
        active organization based on the current date. 


        To retrieve a programs ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/programs prompt endpoint,
        which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
        parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
        the programs by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
        don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the programs
        by active organization based on the current date. 


        To retrieve a gifts ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/gifts prompt endpoint, which
        takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
        parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
        the gifts by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
        don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the gifts by
        active organization based on the current date.

        In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the region. 


        To retrieve a regions ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/regions prompt endpoint,
        which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
        parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
        the regions by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
        don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the regions
        by active organization based on the current date.

        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


        You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/jobClassification/{subResourceID} to
        get the existing data to update. 


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify at least this required field:
        additionalJobClassifications[ {id} ]. 


        To retrieve an additionalJobClassifications ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/jobClassifications prompt endpoint with the
        location and/or staffingEvent query parameter. It returns HREF links to
        job classifications by location for the staffing event. It returns an
        empty result if both location and staffingEvent are not specified. You
        can filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns job
        classifications on the current date.

        Initiates a job change request for a specific worker

        Call this method to start a new job change event, which returns a new
        job change ID. Use the new ID to reference the job change event in
        subsequent methods that update or get information about the same event.


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this POST method.  The
        updates in this POST method do not persist until you call POST
        /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify at least this required field: date, worker
        {id}, job {id}, reason {id}


        To retrieve a worker ID, call the GET /values/jobChangesGroup/workers
        prompt endpoint with the effectiveDate query parameter. It returns HREF
        links to workers by category. You can filter the results by
        effectiveDate. By default, it returns workers on the current date. Only
        workers without blocking events or available for change job for the
        current user are returned.


        To retrieve a job ID, call the GET /values/jobChangesGroup/jobs prompt
        endpoint with the worker query parameter.  It returns all positions for
        the worker with current user access to do a job change. You can filter
        the results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns positions on the
        current date. 


        To retrieve a reason ID, call the GET /values/jobChangesGroup/reason
        prompt endpoint, which takes the job change ID as the staffingEvent
        query parameter. If you specify the staffingEvent parameter, it returns
        change job reasons for the staffingEvent, by the change job category. By
        default, it returns all change job categories and reasons.


        To retrieve a supervisoryOrganization ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/supervisoryOrganization prompt endpoint, with
        proposedManager and effectiveDate query parameters. If you specify the
        proposedManager parameter, it returns HREF links to all supervisory
        organizations for that manager. If you specify effectiveDate, it filters
        the results by effective date. The default is the current date.


        To retrieve a location ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/locations prompt endpoint, which takes the
        staffingEvent query parameter.  It returns HREF links to locations by
        location categories for the specified location. You can filter the
        results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns locations on the
        current date.

        Partially updates the opening options for the specified job change ID. 

        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


        You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/opening/{subResourceID} to get the
        existing data to update. 


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify at least this required field:
        headcountOption{id} 


        To retrieve a headcountOption ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/headcountOptions prompt endpoint, which takes
        the job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. By default, it
        returns all headcount options.

        The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


        You can call GET
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/costCenter/{subResourceID} to get
        the existing data to update. 


        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


        In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the cost center. 


        To retrieve a costCenter ID, call the GET
        /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/costCenters prompt endpoint,
        which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
        parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
        the cost centers by organization, as of the event's effective date. If
        you don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the cost
        centers by active organization based on the current date.

        You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/contract/{subResourceID} to get the

        The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
        updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
        /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.



        To retrieve a frequency ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/frequencies prompt endpoint, which takes the job
        change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. It returns all
        frequencies based on staffing event for contingent workers. By default,
        it returns all frequencies in the tenant.


        To retrieve a currency ID, call the GET
        /values/jobChangesGroup/currencies prompt endpoint, which takes the job
        change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
        staffingEvent parameter, it returns HREF links to active currencies by
        prompt category. By default, it returns all active currencies.
