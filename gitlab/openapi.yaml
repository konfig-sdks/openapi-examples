    An OpenAPI definition for the GitLab REST API.

    Few API resources or endpoints are currently included.

    The intent is to expand this to match the entire Markdown documentation of
    the API:

    <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/>. Contributions are welcome.


    When viewing this on gitlab.com, you can test API calls directly from the
    browser

    against the `gitlab.com` instance, if you are logged in.

    The feature uses the current [GitLab session
    cookie](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/index.html#session-cookie),

    so each request is made using your account.


    Instructions for using this tool can be found in [Interactive API
    Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/openapi/openapi_interactive.html)
