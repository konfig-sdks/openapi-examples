    # Introduction


    The DigitalOcean API allows you to manage Droplets and resources within the

    DigitalOcean cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP
    requests.


    All of the functionality that you are familiar with in the DigitalOcean

    control panel is also available through the API, allowing you to script the

    complex actions that your situation requires.


    The API documentation will start with a general overview about the design

    and technology that has been implemented, followed by reference information

    about specific endpoints.


    ## Requests


    Any tool that is fluent in HTTP can communicate with the API simply by

    requesting the correct URI. Requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol

    so that traffic is encrypted. The interface responds to different methods

    depending on the action required.


    |Method|Usage|

    |--- |--- |

    |GET|For simple retrieval of information about your account, Droplets, or
    environment, you should use the GET method.  The information you request
    will be returned to you as a JSON object. The attributes defined by the JSON
    object can be used to form additional requests.  Any request using the GET
    method is read-only and will not affect any of the objects you are
    querying.|

    |DELETE|To destroy a resource and remove it from your account and
    environment, the DELETE method should be used.  This will remove the
    specified object if it is found.  If it is not found, the operation will
    return a response indicating that the object was not found. This idempotency
    means that you do not have to check for a resource's availability prior to
    issuing a delete command, the final state will be the same regardless of its
    existence.|

    |PUT|To update the information about a resource in your account, the PUT
    method is available. Like the DELETE Method, the PUT method is idempotent. 
    It sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of
    their current values. Requests using the PUT method do not need to check the
    current attributes of the object.|

    |PATCH|Some resources support partial modification. In these cases, the
    PATCH method is available. Unlike PUT which generally requires a complete
    representation of a resource, a PATCH request is is a set of instructions on
    how to modify a resource updating only specific attributes.|

    |POST|To create a new object, your request should specify the POST method.
    The POST request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new
    object.  When you wish to create a new object, send a POST request to the
    target endpoint.|

    |HEAD|Finally, to retrieve metadata information, you should use the HEAD
    method to get the headers.  This returns only the header of what would be
    returned with an associated GET request. Response headers contain some
    useful information about your API access and the results that are available
    for your request. For instance, the headers contain your current rate-limit
    value and the amount of time available until the limit resets. It also
    contains metrics about the total number of objects found, pagination
    information, and the total content length.|



    ## HTTP Statuses


    Along with the HTTP methods that the API responds to, it will also return

    standard HTTP statuses, including error codes.


    In the event of a problem, the status will contain the error code, while the

    body of the response will usually contain additional information about the

    problem that was encountered.


    In general, if the status returned is in the 200 range, it indicates that

    the request was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.


    Return codes in the 400 range typically indicate that there was an issue

    with the request that was sent. Among other things, this could mean that you

    did not authenticate correctly, that you are requesting an action that you

    do not have authorization for, that the object you are requesting does not

    exist, or that your request is malformed.


    If you receive a status in the 500 range, this generally indicates a

    server-side problem. This means that we are having an issue on our end and

    cannot fulfill your request currently.


    400 and 500 level error responses will include a JSON object in their body,

    including the following attributes:


    |Name|Type|Description|

    |--- |--- |--- |

    |id|string|A short identifier corresponding to the HTTP status code
    returned. For example, the ID for a response returning a 404 status code
    would be "not_found."|

    |message|string|A message providing additional information about the error,
    including details to help resolve it when possible.|

    |request_id|string|Optionally, some endpoints may include a request ID that
    should be provided when reporting bugs or opening support tickets to help
    identify the issue.|


    ### Example Error Response


    ```
        HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
        {
          "id":       "forbidden",
          "message":  "You do not have access for the attempted action."
        }
    ```


    ## Responses


    When a request is successful, a response body will typically be sent back in

    the form of a JSON object. An exception to this is when a DELETE request is

    processed, which will result in a successful HTTP 204 status and an empty

    response body.


    Inside of this JSON object, the resource root that was the target of the

    request will be set as the key. This will be the singular form of the word

    if the request operated on a single object, and the plural form of the word

    if a collection was processed.


    For example, if you send a GET request to `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID` you

    will get back an object with a key called "`droplet`". However, if you send

    the GET request to the general collection at `/v2/droplets`, you will get

    back an object with a key called "`droplets`".


    The value of these keys will generally be a JSON object for a request on a

    single object and an array of objects for a request on a collection of

    objects.


    ### Response for a Single Object


    ```
        {
            "droplet": {
                "name": "example.com"
                . . .
            }
        }
    ```


    ### Response for an Object Collection


    ```
        {
            "droplets": [
                {
                    "name": "example.com"
                    . . .
                },
                {
                    "name": "second.com"
                    . . .
                }
            ]
        }
    ```


    ## Meta


    In addition to the main resource root, the response may also contain a

    `meta` object. This object contains information about the response itself.


    The `meta` object contains a `total` key that is set to the total number of

    objects returned by the request. This has implications on the `links` object

    and pagination.


    The `meta` object will only be displayed when it has a value. Currently, the

    `meta` object will have a value when a request is made on a collection (like

    `droplets` or `domains`).



    ### Sample Meta Object


    ```
        {
            . . .
            "meta": {
                "total": 43
            }
            . . .
        }
    ```


    ## Links & Pagination


    The `links` object is returned as part of the response body when pagination

    is enabled. By default, 20 objects are returned per page. If the response

    contains 20 objects or fewer, no `links` object will be returned. If the

    response contains more than 20 objects, the first 20 will be returned along

    with the `links` object.


    You can request a different pagination limit or force pagination by

    appending `?per_page=` to the request with the number of items you would

    like per page. For instance, to show only two results per page, you could

    add `?per_page=2` to the end of your query. The maximum number of results

    per page is 200.


    The `links` object contains a `pages` object. The `pages` object, in turn,

    contains keys indicating the relationship of additional pages. The values of

    these are the URLs of the associated pages. The keys will be one of the

    following:


    *   **first**: The URI of the first page of results.

    *   **prev**: The URI of the previous sequential page of results.

    *   **next**: The URI of the next sequential page of results.

    *   **last**: The URI of the last page of results.


    The `pages` object will only include the links that make sense. So for the

    first page of results, no `first` or `prev` links will ever be set. This

    convention holds true in other situations where a link would not make sense.


    ### Sample Links Object


    ```
        {
            . . .
            "links": {
                "pages": {
                    "last": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2",
                    "next": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2"
                }
            }
            . . .
        }
    ```


    ## Rate Limit


    Requests through the API are rate limited per OAuth token. Current rate
    limits:


    *   5,000 requests per hour

    *   250 requests per minute (5% of the hourly total)


    Once you exceed either limit, you will be rate limited until the next cycle

    starts. Space out any requests that you would otherwise issue in bursts for

    the best results.


    The rate limiting information is contained within the response headers of

    each request. The relevant headers are:


    *   **ratelimit-limit**: The number of requests that can be made per hour.

    *   **ratelimit-remaining**: The number of requests that remain before you
    hit your request limit. See the information below for how the request limits
    expire.

    *   **ratelimit-reset**: This represents the time when the oldest request
    will expire. The value is given in [Unix epoch
    time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). See below for more
    information about how request limits expire.


    More rate limiting information is returned only within burst limit error
    response headers:

    *   **retry-after**: The number of seconds to wait before making another
    request when rate limited.


    As long as the `ratelimit-remaining` count is above zero, you will be able

    to make additional requests.


    The way that a request expires and is removed from the current limit count

    is important to understand. Rather than counting all of the requests for an

    hour and resetting the `ratelimit-remaining` value at the end of the hour,

    each request instead has its own timer.


    This means that each request contributes toward the `ratelimit-remaining`

    count for one complete hour after the request is made. When that request's

    timer runs out, it is no longer counted towards the request limit.


    This has implications on the meaning of the `ratelimit-reset` header as

    well. Because the entire rate limit is not reset at one time, the value of

    this header is set to the time when the _oldest_ request will expire.


    Keep this in mind if you see your `ratelimit-reset` value change, but not

    move an entire hour into the future.


    If the `ratelimit-remaining` reaches zero, subsequent requests will receive

    a 429 error code until the request reset has been reached. 


    `ratelimit-remaining` reaching zero can also indicate that the "burst limit"
    of 250 

    requests per minute limit was met, even if the 5,000 requests per hour limit
    was not. 

    In this case, the 429 error response will include a retry-after header to
    indicate how 

    long to wait (in seconds) until the request may be retried.


    You can see the format of the response in the examples. 


    **Note:** The following endpoints have special rate limit requirements that

    are independent of the limits defined above.


    *   Only 12 `POST` requests to the `/v2/floating_ips` endpoint to create
    Floating IPs can be made per 60 seconds.

    *   Only 10 `GET` requests to the `/v2/account/keys` endpoint to list SSH
    keys can be made per 60 seconds.

    *   Only 5 requests to any and all `v2/cdn/endpoints` can be made per 10
    seconds. This includes `v2/cdn/endpoints`, 
        `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID`, and `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache`.
    *   Only 50 strings within the `files` json struct in the
    `v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache`
    [payload](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#operation/cdn_purge_cache) 
        can be requested every 20 seconds.

    ### Sample Rate Limit Headers


    ```
        . . .
        ratelimit-limit: 1200
        ratelimit-remaining: 1193
        rateLimit-reset: 1402425459
        . . .
    ```

      ### Sample Rate Limit Headers When Burst Limit is Reached:

    ```
        . . .
        ratelimit-limit: 5000
        ratelimit-remaining: 0
        rateLimit-reset: 1402425459
        retry-after: 29
        . . .
    ```


    ### Sample Rate Exceeded Response


    ```
        429 Too Many Requests
        {
                id: "too_many_requests",
                message: "API Rate limit exceeded."
        }
    ```


    ## Curl Examples


    Throughout this document, some example API requests will be given using the

    `curl` command. This will allow us to demonstrate the various endpoints in a

    simple, textual format.
      
      These examples assume that you are using a Linux or macOS command line. To run
    these commands on a Windows machine, you can either use cmd.exe, PowerShell,
    or WSL:


    * For cmd.exe, use the `set VAR=VALUE`
    [syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1)

    to define environment variables, call them with `%VAR%`, then replace all
    backslashes (`\`) in the examples with carets (`^`).


    * For PowerShell, use the `$Env:VAR = "VALUE"`
    [syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.2)

    to define environment variables, call them with `$Env:VAR`, then replace
    `curl` with `curl.exe` and all backslashes (`\`) in the examples with
    backticks (`` ` ``).


    * WSL is a compatibility layer that allows you to emulate a Linux terminal
    on a Windows machine.

    Install WSL with our [community
    tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-on-microsoft-windows-10), 

    then follow this API documentation normally.


    The names of account-specific references (like Droplet IDs, for instance)

    will be represented by variables. For instance, a Droplet ID may be

    represented by a variable called `$DROPLET_ID`. You can set the associated

    variables in your environment if you wish to use the examples without

    modification.


    The first variable that you should set to get started is your OAuth

    authorization token. The next section will go over the details of this, but

    you can set an environmental variable for it now.


    Generate a token by going to the [Apps &
    API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications)

    section of the DigitalOcean control panel. Use an existing token if you have

    saved one, or generate a new token with the "Generate new token" button.

    Copy the generated token and use it to set and export the TOKEN variable in

    your environment as the example shows.


    You may also wish to set some other variables now or as you go along. For

    example, you may wish to set the `DROPLET_ID` variable to one of your

    Droplet IDs since this will be used frequently in the API.


    If you are following along, make sure you use a Droplet ID that you control

    so that your commands will execute correctly.


    If you need access to the headers of a response through `curl`, you can pass

    the `-i` flag to display the header information along with the body. If you

    are only interested in the header, you can instead pass the `-I` flag, which

    will exclude the response body entirely.



    ### Set and Export your OAuth Token


    ```

    export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_token_here

    ```


    ### Set and Export a Variable


    ```

    export DROPLET_ID=1111111

    ```


    ## Parameters


    There are two different ways to pass parameters in a request with the API.


    When passing parameters to create or update an object, parameters should be

    passed as a JSON object containing the appropriate attribute names and

    values as key-value pairs. When you use this format, you should specify that

    you are sending a JSON object in the header. This is done by setting the

    `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. This ensures that your request

    is interpreted correctly.


    When passing parameters to filter a response on GET requests, parameters can

    be passed using standard query attributes. In this case, the parameters

    would be embedded into the URI itself by appending a `?` to the end of the

    URI and then setting each attribute with an equal sign. Attributes can be

    separated with a `&`. Tools like `curl` can create the appropriate URI when

    given parameters and values; this can also be done using the `-F` flag and

    then passing the key and value as an argument. The argument should take the

    form of a quoted string with the attribute being set to a value with an

    equal sign.


    ### Pass Parameters as a JSON Object


    ```
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"name": "example.com", "ip_address": "127.0.0.1"}' \
            -X POST "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/domains"
    ```


    ### Pass Filter Parameters as a Query String


    ```
         curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
             -X GET \
             "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?private=true"
    ```


    ## Cross Origin Resource Sharing


    In order to make requests to the API from other domains, the API implements

    Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.


    CORS support is generally used to create AJAX requests outside of the domain

    that the request originated from. This is necessary to implement projects

    like control panels utilizing the API. This tells the browser that it can

    send requests to an outside domain.


    The procedure that the browser initiates in order to perform these actions

    (other than GET requests) begins by sending a "preflight" request. This sets

    the `Origin` header and uses the `OPTIONS` method. The server will reply

    back with the methods it allows and some of the limits it imposes. The

    client then sends the actual request if it falls within the allowed

    constraints.


    This process is usually done in the background by the browser, but you can

    use curl to emulate this process using the example provided. The headers

    that will be set to show the constraints are:


    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: This is the domain that is sent by the
    client or browser as the origin of the request. It is set through an
    `Origin` header.

    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: This specifies the allowed options for
    requests from that domain. This will generally be all available methods.

    *   **Access-Control-Expose-Headers**: This will contain the headers that
    will be available to requests from the origin domain.

    *   **Access-Control-Max-Age**: This is the length of time that the access
    is considered valid. After this expires, a new preflight should be sent.

    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**: This will be set to `true`. It
    basically allows you to send your OAuth token for authentication.


    You should not need to be concerned with the details of these headers,

    because the browser will typically do all of the work for you.

      DigitalOcean's [managed database
      service](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases)

      simplifies the creation and management of highly available database
      clusters. Currently, it

      offers support for
      [PostgreSQL](http://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/),

      [Redis](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/redis/),

      [MySQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/mysql/), and

      [MongoDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/mongodb/).


      By sending requests to the `/v2/databases` endpoint, you can list, create,
      or delete

      database clusters as well as scale the size of a cluster, add or remove
      read-only replicas,

      and manage other configuration details.


      Database clusters may be deployed in a multi-node, high-availability
      configuration.

      If your machine type is above the basic nodes, your node plan is above the
      smallest option,

      or you are running MongoDB, you may additionally include up to two standby
      nodes in your cluster.


      The size of individual nodes in a database cluster is represented by a
      human-readable slug,

      which is used in some of the following requests. Each slug denotes the
      node's identifier,

      CPU count, and amount of RAM, in that order.


      For a list of currently available database slugs and options, use the
      `/v2/databases/options` endpoint or use the 

      `doctl databases options`
      [command](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/reference/databases/options).

      [DigitalOcean Block Storage
      Volumes](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/volumes/)

      provide expanded storage capacity for your Droplets and can be moved

      between Droplets within a specific region.


      Volumes function as raw block devices, meaning they appear to the

      operating system as locally attached storage which can be formatted using

      any file system supported by the OS. They may be created in sizes from

      1GiB to 16TiB.

      A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently Droplets,

      Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters) in order to

      better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.


      Tags have two attributes: a user defined `name` attribute and an embedded

      `resources` attribute with information about resources that have been
      tagged.
    name: Tags

      A DigitalOcean [image](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/) can be

      used to create a Droplet and may come in a number of flavors. Currently,

      there are five types of images: snapshots, backups, applications,

      distributions, and custom images.


      * [Snapshots](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/) provide

      a full copy of an existing Droplet instance taken on demand.


      * [Backups](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/backups/) are similar

      to snapshots but are created automatically at regular intervals when

      enabled for a Droplet.


      * [Custom images](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/custom-images/)

      are Linux-based virtual machine images (raw, qcow2, vhdx, vdi, and vmdk

      formats are supported) that you may upload for use on DigitalOcean.


      * Distributions are the public Linux distributions that are available to

      be used as a base to create Droplets.


      * Applications, or [1-Click
      Apps](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/),

      are distributions pre-configured with additional software.


      To interact with images, you will generally send requests to the images

      Droplet actions are tasks that can be executed on a Droplet. These can be
      things like rebooting, resizing, snapshotting, etc.

      Droplet action requests are generally targeted at one of the "actions"
      endpoints for a specific Droplet. The specific actions are usually
      initiated by sending a POST request with the action and arguments as
      parameters.

      Droplet action requests create a Droplet actions object, which can be used
      to get information about the status of an action. Creating a Droplet
      action is asynchronous: the HTTP call will return the action object before
      the action has finished processing on the Droplet. The current status of
      an action can be retrieved from either the Droplet actions endpoint or the
      global actions endpoint. If a Droplet action is uncompleted it may block
      the creation of a subsequent action for that Droplet, the locked attribute
      of the Droplet will be true and attempts to create a Droplet action will
      fail with a status of 422.

      As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the Floating IP product to [Reserved
      IPs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Reserved-IPs).

      The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact same way as
      Floating IPs.

      The only difference is the name change throughout the URLs and fields.

      For example, the `floating_ips` field is now the `reserved_ips` field.

      The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being

      permanently deprecated.


      With the exception of the [Projects
      API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Projects),

      we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across
      the API

      where the `floating_ip` field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata
      response

      will contain the field `reserved_ips` in addition to the `floating_ips`

      [DigitalOcean Floating
      IPs](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/floating-ips/)

      are publicly-accessible static IP addresses that can be mapped to one of

      DigitalOcean.


      ### Supported Resource Types Examples


      Projects resources are identified by uniform resource names or URNs. A

      valid URN has the following format: `do:resource_type:resource_id`. The

      following resource types are supported:


      Resource Type      | Example URN

      -------------------|------------

      App Platform App   | `do:app:be5aab85-851b-4cab-b2ed-98d5a63ba4e8`

      Floating IP        | `do:floatingip:192.168.99.100`

      Kubernetes Cluster | `do:kubernetes:bd5f5959-5e1e-4205-a714-a914373942af`

      Space              | `do:space:my-website-assets`

      Volume             | `do:volume:6fc4c277-ea5c-448a-93cd-dd496cfef71f`


      ### Resource Status Codes


      When assigning and retrieving resources in projects, a `status` attribute

      is returned that indicates if a resource was successfully retrieved or

      assigned. The status codes can be one of the following:


      Status Code        | Explanation

      -------------------|------------

      `ok`               | There was no problem retrieving or assigning a
      resource.

      `assigned`         | The resource was successfully assigned.

        To create a database cluster, send a POST request to `/v2/databases`.

        The response will be a JSON object with a key called `database`. The
        value of this will be an object that contains the standard attributes
        associated with a database cluster. The initial value of the database
        cluster's `status` attribute will be `creating`. When the cluster is
        ready to receive traffic, this will transition to `online`.


        The embedded `connection` and `private_connection` objects will contain
        the information needed to access the database cluster. For multi-node
        clusters, the `standby_connection` and `standby_private_connection`
        objects will contain the information needed to connect to the cluster's
        standby node(s).


        DigitalOcean managed PostgreSQL and MySQL database clusters take
        automated daily backups. To create a new database cluster based on a
        backup of an existing cluster, send a POST request to `/v2/databases`.
        In addition to the standard database cluster attributes, the JSON body
        must include a key named `backup_restore` with the name of the original
        database cluster and the timestamp of the backup to be restored.
        Creating a database from a backup is the same as forking a database in
        the control panel.

        Note: Backups are not supported for Redis clusters.

        For PostgreSQL database clusters, connection pools can be used to allow
        a

        database to share its idle connections. The popular PostgreSQL
        connection

        pooling utility PgBouncer is used to provide this service. [See here for
        more
        information](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/postgresql/how-to/manage-connection-pools/)

        about how and why to use PgBouncer connection pooling including

        details about the available transaction modes.


        To add a new connection pool to a PostgreSQL database cluster, send a
        POST

        request to `/v2/databases/$DATABASE_ID/pools` specifying a name for the
        pool,

        the user to connect with, the database to connect to, as well as its
        desired

        size and transaction mode.

        To get a listing of all records configured for a domain, send a GET
        request to `/v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records`.

        The list of records returned can be filtered by using the `name` and
        `type` query parameters. For example, to only include A records for a
        domain, send a GET request to `/v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?type=A`.
        `name` must be a fully qualified record name. For example, to only
        include records matching `sub.example.com`, send a GET request to
        `/v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?name=sub.example.com`. Both name and
        type may be used together.

        The response body will be a JSON object with a key of `droplets`. This

        ### Filtering Results by Tag


        It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query
        parameters.

        To only list Droplets assigned to a specific tag, include the `tag_name`
        query

        parameter set to the name of the tag in your GET request. For example,

        `/v2/droplets?tag_name=$TAG_NAME`.

        To create a new Droplet, send a POST request to `/v2/droplets` setting
        the

        required attributes.


        A Droplet will be created using the provided information. The response
        body

        will contain a JSON object with a key called `droplet`. The value will
        be an

        object containing the standard attributes for your new Droplet. The
        response

        code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of the
        operation,

        just that the request has been accepted for processing. The `actions`
        returned

        as part of the response's `links` object can be used to check the status

        of the Droplet create event.


        ### Create Multiple Droplets


        Creating multiple Droplets is very similar to creating a single Droplet.

        Instead of sending `name` as a string, send `names` as an array of
        strings. A

        Droplet will be created for each name you send using the associated

        information. Up to ten Droplets may be created this way at a time.


        Rather than returning a single Droplet, the response body will contain a
        JSON

        array with a key called `droplets`. This will be set to an array of JSON

        objects, each of which will contain the standard Droplet attributes. The

        response code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of
        any

        operation, just that the request has been accepted for processing. The
        array

        of `actions` returned as part of the response's `links` object can be
        used to

        check the status of each individual Droplet create event.

        | Action                                   | Details |

        | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |

        | <nobr>`enable_backups`</nobr>            | Enables backups for a
        Droplet |

        | <nobr>`disable_backups`</nobr>           | Disables backups for a
        Droplet |

        | <nobr>`reboot`</nobr>                    | Reboots a Droplet. A
        `reboot` action is an attempt to reboot the Droplet in a graceful way,
        similar to using the `reboot` command from the console. |

        | <nobr>`power_cycle`</nobr>               | Power cycles a Droplet. A
        `powercycle` action is similar to pushing the reset button on a physical
        machine, it's similar to booting from scratch. |

        | <nobr>`shutdown`</nobr>                  | Shutsdown a Droplet. A
        shutdown action is an attempt to shutdown the Droplet in a graceful way,
        similar to using the `shutdown` command from the console. Since a
        `shutdown` command can fail, this action guarantees that the command is
        issued, not that it succeeds. The preferred way to turn off a Droplet is
        to attempt a shutdown, with a reasonable timeout, followed by a
        `power_off` action to ensure the Droplet is off. |

        | <nobr>`power_off`</nobr>                 | Powers off a Droplet. A
        `power_off` event is a hard shutdown and should only be used if the
        `shutdown` action is not successful. It is similar to cutting the power
        on a server and could lead to complications. |

        | <nobr>`power_on`</nobr>                  | Powers on a Droplet. |

        | <nobr>`restore`</nobr>                   | Restore a Droplet using a
        backup image. The image ID that is passed in must be a backup of the
        current Droplet instance. The operation will leave any embedded SSH keys
        intact. |

        | <nobr>`password_reset`</nobr>            | Resets the root password
        for a Droplet. A new password will be provided via email. It must be
        changed after first use. |

        | <nobr>`resize`</nobr>                    | Resizes a Droplet. Set the
        `size` attribute to a size slug. If a permanent resize with disk changes
        included is desired, set the `disk` attribute to `true`. |

        | <nobr>`rebuild`</nobr>                   | Rebuilds a Droplet from a
        new base image. Set the `image` attribute to an image ID or slug. |

        | <nobr>`rename`</nobr>                    | Renames a Droplet. |

        | <nobr>`change_kernel`</nobr>             | Changes a Droplet's kernel.
        Only applies to Droplets with externally managed kernels. All Droplets
        created after March 2017 use internal kernels by default. |

        | <nobr>`enable_ipv6`</nobr>               | Enables IPv6 for a Droplet.
        Once enabled for a Droplet, IPv6 can not be disabled. When enabling IPv6
        on an existing Droplet, [additional OS-level
        configuration](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/ipv6/how-to/enable/#on-existing-droplets)
        is required. |

        | <nobr>`snapshot`</nobr>                  | Takes a snapshot of a
        Droplet. |

        ## Filtering Results

        -----


        It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query
        parameters.


        **Image Type**


        Either 1-Click Application or OS Distribution images can be filtered by
        using the `type` query parameter.


        > Important: The `type` query parameter does not directly relate to the
        `type` attribute.


        To retrieve only ***distribution*** images, include the `type` query
        parameter set to distribution, `/v2/images?type=distribution`.


        To retrieve only ***application*** images, include the `type` query
        parameter set to application, `/v2/images?type=application`.


        **User Images**


        To retrieve only the private images of a user, include the `private`
        query parameter set to true, `/v2/images?private=true`.


        **Tags**


        To list all images assigned to a specific tag, include the `tag_name`
        query parameter set to the name of the tag in your GET request. For
        example, `/v2/images?tag_name=$TAG_NAME`.

        ## Convert an Image to a Snapshot


        To convert an image, for example, a backup to a snapshot, send a POST
        request

        to `/v2/images/$IMAGE_ID/actions`. Set the `type` attribute to
        `convert`.


        ## Transfer an Image


        To transfer an image to another region, send a POST request to

        `/v2/images/$IMAGE_ID/actions`. Set the `type` attribute to `transfer`
        and set

        `region` attribute to the slug identifier of the region you wish to
        transfer

        to.

        You can specify the Droplets that will sit behind the load balancer
        using one

        of two methods:


        * Set `droplet_ids` to a list of specific Droplet IDs.

        * Set `tag` to the name of a tag. All Droplets with this tag applied
        will be
          assigned to the load balancer. Additional Droplets will be automatically
          assigned as they are tagged.

        These methods are mutually exclusive.

        In order to access your container registry with the Docker client or
        from a

        Kubernetes cluster, you will need to configure authentication. The
        necessary

        JSON configuration can be retrieved by sending a GET request to

        `/v2/registry/docker-credentials`.


        The response will be in the format of a Docker `config.json` file. To
        use the

        config in your Kubernetes cluster, create a Secret with:

            kubectl create secret generic docr \
              --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=config.json \
              --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson

        By default, the returned credentials have read-only access to your
        registry

        and cannot be used to push images. This is appropriate for most
        Kubernetes

        clusters. To retrieve read/write credentials, suitable for use with the
        Docker

        client or in a CI system, read_write may be provided as query parameter.
        For

        example: `/v2/registry/docker-credentials?read_write=true`


        By default, the returned credentials will not expire. To retrieve
        credentials

        with an expiry set, expiry_seconds may be provided as a query parameter.
        For

        example: `/v2/registry/docker-credentials?expiry_seconds=3600` will
        return

        credentials that expire after one hour.

        Garbage collection enables users to clear out unreferenced blobs (layer
        &

        manifest data) after deleting one or more manifests from a repository.
        If

        there are no unreferenced blobs resulting from the deletion of one or
        more

        manifests, garbage collection is effectively a noop.

        [See here for more
        information](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/container-registry/how-to/clean-up-container-registry/)

        about how and why you should clean up your container registry
        periodically.


        To request a garbage collection run on your registry, send a POST
        request to

        `/v2/registry/$REGISTRY_NAME/garbage-collection`. This will initiate the

        following sequence of events on your registry.


        * Set the registry to read-only mode, meaning no further write-scoped
          JWTs will be issued to registry clients. Existing write-scoped JWTs will
          continue to work until they expire which can take up to 15 minutes.
        * Wait until all existing write-scoped JWTs have expired.

        * Scan all registry manifests to determine which blobs are unreferenced.

        * Delete all unreferenced blobs from the registry.

        * Record the number of blobs deleted and bytes freed, mark the garbage
          collection status as `success`.
        * Remove the read-only mode restriction from the registry, meaning
        write-scoped
          JWTs will once again be issued to registry clients.

        There are multiple subscription tiers available for container registry.
        Each tier allows a different number of image repositories to be created
        in your registry, and has a different amount of storage and transfer
        included.

        There are multiple regions available for container registry and controls
        where your data is stored.

        To list the available options, send a GET request to

      description: >
        To list all of the snapshots available on your account, send a GET
        request to

        `/v2/snapshots`.


        The response will be a JSON object with a key called `snapshots`. This
        will be

        set to an array of `snapshot` objects, each of which will contain the
        standard

        snapshot attributes.


        ### Filtering Results by Resource Type


        It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query
        parameters.


        #### List Droplet Snapshots


        To retrieve only snapshots based on Droplets, include the
        `resource_type`

        query parameter set to `droplet`. For example,
        `/v2/snapshots?resource_type=droplet`.


        #### List Volume Snapshots


        To retrieve only snapshots based on volumes, include the `resource_type`

        query parameter set to `volume`. For example,
        `/v2/snapshots?resource_type=volume`.

        To list all of the block storage volumes available on your account, send
        a GET request to `/v2/volumes`.

        ## Filtering Results

        ### By Region

        The `region` may be provided as query parameter in order to restrict
        results to volumes available in a specific region. For example:
        `/v2/volumes?region=nyc1`

        ### By Name

        It is also possible to list volumes on your account that match a
        specified name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name as a
        query parameter to `/v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME`.

        **Note:** You can only create one volume per region with the same name.

        ### By Name and Region

        It is also possible to retrieve information about a block storage volume
        by name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name and the
        region slug for the region it is located in as query parameters to
        `/v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME&region=nyc1`.

        will be

        automatically mounted to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Fedora Atomic, and
        CentOS

        Droplets created on or after April 26, 2018 when attached. On older
        Droplets,

        ## OAuth Authentication


        In order to interact with the DigitalOcean API, you or your application
        must

        authenticate.


        The DigitalOcean API handles this through OAuth, an open standard for

        authorization. OAuth allows you to delegate access to your account in
        full

        or in read-only mode.


        You can generate an OAuth token by visiting the [Apps &
        API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)

        section of the DigitalOcean control panel for your account.


        An OAuth token functions as a complete authentication request. In
        effect, it

        acts as a substitute for a username and password pair.


        Because of this, it is absolutely **essential** that you keep your OAuth

        tokens secure. In fact, upon generation, the web interface will only
        display

        each token a single time in order to prevent the token from being
        compromised.


        DigitalOcean access tokens begin with an identifiable prefix in order to

        distinguish them from other similar tokens.


        - `dop_v1_` for personal access tokens generated in the control panel

        - `doo_v1_` for tokens generated by applications using [the OAuth
        flow](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/oauth-api/)

        - `dor_v1_` for OAuth refresh tokens


        ### How to Authenticate with OAuth


        In order to make an authenticated request, include a bearer-type

        `Authorization` header containing your OAuth token. All requests must be

        made over HTTPS.


        ### Authenticate with a Bearer Authorization Header


        ```

        curl -X $HTTP_METHOD -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN"
        "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/$OBJECT"

        ```

    tags:
      description: >-
        A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently Droplets,
        Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters) in order to
        better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.

        Tags have two attributes: a user defined `name` attribute and an
        embedded `resources` attribute with information about resources that
        have been tagged.
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          description: >
            The name of the tag. Tags may contain letters, numbers, colons,
            dashes, and underscores.

            There is a limit of 255 characters per tag.


            **Note:** Tag names are case stable, which means the capitalization
            you use when you first create a tag is canonical.


            When working with tags in the API, you must use the tag's canonical
            capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", the
            URL to add that tag to a resource would be
            `https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/tags/PROD/resources` (not
            `/v2/tags/prod/resources`).


            Tagged resources in the control panel will always display the
            canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named
            "PROD", you can tag resources in the control panel by entering
            "prod". The tag will still display with its canonical
            capitalization, "PROD".

        The `type` query parameter is not directly related to the `type`
        attribute.

        The main thing to remember here is that DigitalOcean-produced
        distribution images will have `snapshot` as the type attribute.
